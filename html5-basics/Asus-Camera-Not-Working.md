What I mean by works or doesn't is that google camera let's me select which lens I'm using - so if I use the 12MP everything works, but if I select the 64MP lens - nothing works.
 
Regarding the native Asus camera app - I guess something in the software doesn't like that the 64MP isn't working and so - you basically see a "black-screen". However, if you push around where the various camera modes are - you'll eventually find that PANO mode. What happens is the display now works - - why because by default the PANO mode using the 12MP lens.

There are 2 modes that directly work when going into them:
 - PANO - this always seems to work as PANO defaults to using the 12MP lens
 - VIDEO - this "works" as long as hyper-steady is "on"
 
Jesus Christ man, everything you said worked out EXACTLY the same for me. It appears to be a common problem, and only fully solved through customer service, but to my luck my warranty expired a few months back and people with similar problems reported that the cost of fixing it outside the warranty is almost more than the price of a new Zenfone 8 in my country and this is INFURIATING. Please keep us informed if a full factory reset changes anything, even though I saw some people saying it doesn't change anything.
 
Further testing showed that while the 64MP camera does open on the PRO mode after coming from PANO, the focus is very botched and trying to adjust just freezes the camera as usual. Maybe this can mean that there's something wrong with the focusing mechanism/software?
 
From the accounts of people that sent their phones to customer service (out of warranty) in my country, I found out that what the service does is to replace the phone's motherboard and camera module, it takes almost a month to do it and it costs about what a brand new Zenfone 8 would.
 
Hello, I'd really appreciate some ideas. After upgrading Zoom on Friday (and uninstalling / re-installing several times since) my Asus laptop camera has stopped working in Zoom meetings on Windows 10. The camera works with other programmes like Teams and Google Meet and I've tried all of the things that I've seen others trying (rebooting computer, updating camera drivers, checking no conflicting programmes, checking all settings and permissions etc.) to no avail. I even had my work IT team remote in and take a look and they had no idea, either - they just tried everything I did.

How did you get your camera to work? My zoom camera stopped working on my ASUS laptop recently too. It worked in the morning and then it stopped working in the afternoon. I see a blurred grey background with a small camera in the middle, that's it. The camera work for other applications but not zoom.:(
 
Our work purchased approximately 700 Asus eee 1001HA netbooks about 5 years ago and up until a few months ago, we had no use or purpose for the webcams. We changed our processes to make better use of the webcams, and when we went to deploy the updated software, we found that the webcams wouldn't work on approximately 20% of them.
 
We tried a variety of different things to get these webcams working, from disabling them in the BIOS, to formatting and factory resetting the machines, without any luck. I even tried booting into a Ubuntu disk to see if I could detect anything (I couldn't).
 
It seemed the only solution we had was to physically remove the web cam hardware, swap it over with a working one and boot the machine, then when it had recognised it, swap it back for the old camera. This of course is far too time intensive as each netbook would take about 10 minutes to swap over.
 
I revisited it the other day and found that by disabling the webcam in the BIOS and re-enabling it, it started to work again. Excitedly, I tried this in a second netbook and was unable to replicate it. After trying 2 or 3 more, I realised that I was just lucky.
 
The other thing I did notice, although it doesn't seem to be a problem today, is that the quality of the web cam image was terrible. It looked to be 160x120 instead of 640x480. However, in booting up all of the netbooks today, I couldn't find one with this problem.
 
TL;DR: I have about 200 netbooks where the webcam doesn't work. The only reliable to fix these is by physically removing the camera, swapping it with a working one and swapping it back. Does anyone have any other suggestions?
 
Ohh what haven't I tried! Flashed the bios, checked if the camera was enabled (it was), checked in tray utility, did the image recovery, everything was ok but nothing helped. Then, on I don't know which google page of my research I run on asus manual. Read it carefully. There is a keyboard shortcut that toggles the camera application on and off! Press the f\*\*\*ing fn+V and it's gonna start working!
 
Hi all, thanks for Fedora 30 which worked out of the box on my device after I had tried many other distros!
The only bits not working are the face camera and the fingerprint sensor.
Here are the results from lsusb and lspci for anybody who can help:
 
I spent the last couple of weeks (2 weeks to be specific) trying to make sense of everything related with having an RGB-D camera working with ROS and then having a Skeleton Tracker working with the sensor.
 
Although the community is amazingly perfect, I had no luck getting Skeleton Tracker working with any of my sensor. I started with Microsoft Kinect One (v2) and after long time spent on it, I switched to ASUS Xtion Pro Live with the hope, I will find something working for it. Unfortunately I didn't!
 
I am working on a project with a deadline and as time passes and I can't have the sensor working the worst. I am in a state where I am not sure (1) if is just the libraries not perfect and they are not working with the sensors I have (2) I do something wrong.
 
I have read almost all ROS Answers regarding similar problems, and the process I am reading and I am following is the same, download OpenNI2 and then NiTE2.0.0 ir NiTE1.5 etc run the sudo ./install.sh then build etc. Never worked although I follow steps highlighted in the libraries READMEs.
 
Hello guys,,, 
I was using Antergos and did a fresh Arch instlall during this quarentine. 
I have a Laptop => ASUS A53S
My built-in webcam was working fine with Antergos but now, I have a problem using Arch. If I load v4l2 or hangouts video, I get a blackscreen video. I can notice my webcam light turns green on top of my laptop.
I tried \_setup solution but my camera didn't initialize. 
xawtv doesn't load 
guvcview loads but not image.
v4l2 loads but no image too.
 
Still waiting for a full dmesg log and not the truncated snippets you have posted. When you post parts of logs, it comes across as though you are trying to hide something. It would give us ideas about hardware, for instance if you had a nvidia card, as you previously said...
 
There are several reasons why your Asus webcam stopped working. It could be related to **privacy settings, function keys coupled to your webcam, outdated device drivers, or even antivirus programs**.
 
Asus has specific function keys, and your web camera links to one of them. This link makes things more secure on the hardware side; unfortunately, some people do not know this and can get their webcams locked.
 
**Step 3**. If this does not solve it right-click on the device. You can choose **Update driver** to update it to the latest version. You can let Windows choose the best driver or pick it from a list. Alternatively, you can download the driver from the Asus website and choose Browse. Consequently, you can download a setup program from the Asus website to install the driver automatically; this should be the easiest method.
 
Every Windows computer nowadays has a restore point that you can access anytime. This restore point will bring your computer back to a known state when your webcam is working correctly. Follow the steps below:
 
**Step 4**. Choose your iPhone as a camera source in the Desktop client. You will now be able to use your video conferencing app with FineCam Virtual Camera as its source by clicking on Virtual Camera ON (the center button).
 
FineCam also enables you to control the webcam videos by zooming in/out, mirroring, rotating, adjusting color & brightness, and more. In addition, it supports adding multiple webcams and scenes for complex presentation use.
 
You can fix your Asus laptop webcam through the steps mentioned above. As with device issues, it involves a bit of troubleshooting. You can be an Asus webcam expert troubleshooter with a bit of practice.
 
ASUS laptops are known for their high performance and sleek design. However, like every other technology, they can experience issues. One common problem users may encounter with the built-in camera. And whether you are trying to use your camera for video conferencing or creating content, your camera must work properly.
 
Also, there are other reasons why your ASUS laptop camera is showing a black screen. Another cause might be that the camera is physically obstructed, obscured, or destroyed. This may occur if a protective sticker covers the camera lens or if an item is obscuring the lens. In this situation, remove any obstructions and check whether the camera is operating again. Furthermore, if the camera is damaged, it may need to be fixed or replaced.
