I am trying to setup sonarqube community edition locally to give it a try. I user docker instance of sonarqube server (8.9.10-community tag) and sonar scanner for .NET installed via dotnet tools.
I would expect to launch the web server, perform .NET solution analysis and see the results in the dashboard of the WebUI. At the moment I am stuck with the analysis step of the scanner.

We are looking to implement barcode scanners in our facility that have Google Store capabilities for keeping track of inventory, but an area of concern is that it will download the desktop version that does not have the barcode scanning option as the mobile app version does. Based on your knowledge and experience would you know if barcode scanners that have the Google Store would download the mobile app version? I have provided two pictures to hopefully give a little insight on what type of scanners I am referring to. I notice some scanners have Play Store capabilities and others have Google Play capabilities as I am sure this will have an effect on which version is downloaded.
 
The Smartsheet mobile app on Google Play requires Android 8.0 or later as shown in screenshot below. I'm not sure what version of Android your TC20 has. The best way to check compatibility is to open the Play Store on your TC20, search for "Smartsheet," and see if the "Install" button appears. Give it a try and see if it works for you.
 
Reliable and free network scanner to analyze LAN. The program shows all network devices, gives you access to shared folders, provides remote control of computers (via RDP and Radmin), and can even remotely switch computers off. It is easy to use and runs as a portable edition. It should be the first choice for every network admin.
 
My company bought multiple Evernote Edition Scansnap scanners years ago to the tune of $500 each. We've been an Evernote business customer for going on nearly 10 years. Today, for whatever reason, my scanner won't scan. The green button flashes whenever I hit the scan button, and I noticed the Scansnap Manager Evernote Edition software has suddenly disappeared from my PC.
 
So I go on the Evernote site to download it, and can't find the software. But I do see a help article related to updating the firmware on our Evernote Edition scanners so they can become regular IX500 scanners. This seems fantastic. I read all of the instructions, download the firmware update, and when I go to install the application receive an error (attached) saying that I must first install Scansnap Manager Evernote Edition in order to update the firmware on my scanner.


 
Unfortunately, this software appears nowhere on the Evernote web site and disappeared from my computer. I contacted support by chat and was directed to the Fujitsu web site as the source of all downloads, navigated through the menu to find the IX500 which is listed under discontinued models, and of course the Evernote specific software isn't available there either. This software should be on the Evernote website.

I am irritated that for whatever reason, the Evernote Edition software removed itself from my PC, that it's no longer available for download anywhere, and that Evernote support never contacted people who purchased these scanners to inform us of the option to update firmware before removing the prerequisite software required in order to do this firmware update. Support from Evernote has been abysmal. This goes to show how much they care about their customers who spend thousands of dollars with them.

Can someone please give me a download link to the Scansnap Manager Evernote Edition? Otherwise we're going to look at migrating all of our data to another provider and will switch away from Evernote for good.
 
The conversion tool updates the scanners firmware. ScanSnap Home is then needed to configure the new firmware. I am using ScanSnap Manager, that does the job as well, but the official description is for SSH, so better go for it as well.
 
A word about your personal expectations: It is a rare exception to notify users of a product individually that it is eventually phased out. It is normal that technical products reach the end of their support eventually.
 
A quick search with my search engine brought up this web site. It looks legitimate, but it is as always hard to tell for 3rd party sites. Maybe load it to an isolated PC, and run it through an antivirus scan to find out whether it is clean. It seems they have the installer available:
 
Generally spoken the Fujitsu websites are a mess: Hodgepodge of local and global sites, no clear UI, the more technical sites seemingly a weak UI patched over a file database that has access points only experts for the devices will know.
 
1.although the program has ended, apparently Fujitsu just removed the link from the main landing page, and I managed find this page would still has a working link to the conversion tool. I've also triggered a save on the wayback machine for that page, but it may not save the binary. If people behind me couldn't find the conversion tool, try googling "SSEEConvertTool.zip" and see if anyone else on the internet has saved it.
 
2. the evernote edition of the scan snap software could be found at different locations, usually called "PFU\_Scanner\_Installer\_b19.exe", but in it's first step, it will fail to download in step 1 of 2, as shown in one of the screenshots above by another poster. To get around that, you need to first install Evernote legacy, found at one of the reply of the forum link below. After installing it, then run the PFU\_Scanner\_INstaller\_b19.exe and it'll skip step 1 and enter step 2 to download software. However, since it's retrieving something from the Internet still, there is a possibility that in the future it'll fail just like in step 1 of 2.
 
3. Once you have the legacy Evernote installed, and the PFU\_scanner\_installer.exe installed, extract the files from SSEEConvertTool.zip from step #1 and run the conversion exe inside. Then hope everything works.
 
4. if converted without issues, go to Fujitsu's scansnap software download installer site and use "Download Installer". If you try the offline installer you won't be able to find ix500. The online installer worked for me and I was able to scan sucessfully.
 
Yes, that is the article I saw, which links to When I go to the Fujitsu site and read steps 1 through 3.2 as the Evernote article says to read, I get stuck at step 3.2 because when I run the update tool, an error immediately pops up which is the image of the error in my original post above.
 
"Unstable to update the firmware because Evernote Edition is not installed. Install Scansnap Manager Evernote Edition, and then try again."

The issue seems to be that the Scansnap Manager Evernote Edition software isn't available for download anywhere. Do you have any idea as to where I might be able to get that software?
