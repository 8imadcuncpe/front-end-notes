Is Faceswap have any update ? Last time I'm here It's V2.10.0 and now It's still the same.

The time when I do make a release is when there is a significant change to the code that may impact some users. We 'released' version 2.0 when we removed PlaidML support for AMD users. This gives users who would be impacted by the change a version of Faceswap that will still work for them (but will no longer be developed). We then created a new 'release' (2.10) which is where we are at now.
 
Yes it will. This will work most of the time,, and it will just pull the latest code from github (and update the installed dependencies where possible). Sometimes the change is big, and updating from within Faceswap will break things. If this happens you would need to do a fresh install. Fortunately, that is relatively rare.
 
FaceSwapLab is an extension for Stable Diffusion that simplifies the use of insighface models for face-swapping. It has evolved from sd-webui-faceswap and some part of sd-webui-roop. However, a substantial amount of the code has been rewritten to improve performance and to better manage masks.
 
Some key features include the ability to reuse faces via checkpoints, multiple face units, batch process images, sort faces based on size or gender, and support for vladmantic. It also provides a face inpainting feature.

This extension is **not intended to facilitate the creation of not safe for work (NSFW) or non-consensual deepfake content**. Its purpose is to bring consistency to image creation, making it easier to repair existing images, or bring characters back to life.
 
We will comply with European regulations regarding this type of software. As required by law, the code may include both visible and invisible watermarks. If your local laws prohibit the use of this extension, you should not use it.
 
To add new face you have to add it to the faces array with a name that will be used later. In the images param you can add multiples images for each face and each one with their custom position and width if neccesary. The faces should be cropped and have a transparent background.
 
Upload an image to a channel, then run the command /faceswap and a bot will answer with the image with the faces randomly replaces with the faces in your assets/faces.json file. If you want to choose which faces to use just run /faceswap name1,name2
 
Modify correct domain XML file below to point to the downloaded path of your image. For instance, if the downloaded faceswap-server-release.qcow is at /home/junjuew/faceswap-server-release.qcow. Then the xml file should be modified into:
 
The cloudlet image takes a bit longer to be fully booted up and initialized. You can monitor whether the virtual machine has fully booted up by checking whether you've arrived at log-in shell through virt-manager console.
 
If you want to customize the content of the image, the default username:password is **faceswap-admin:faceswap-admin**. Password-based ssh in Cloudlet images are by default turned on. You're advised to change the password as soon as you gain access.
