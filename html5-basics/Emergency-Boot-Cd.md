I started the update accepting the default selections, and while installing there was only one warning prompt regarding NVIDIA driver, which I ignored. I did not check the logs in package manager, so cannot say whether there were other problems.
 
Unfortunately, it did not solve the problem. It tried as @GaVenga suggested, once with the extra steps for NVIDIA (which, if I understand correctly, uninstalls and reinstalls a package named video-linux), and once without. But I am still getting the same error.

I interpreted this as they removed the old entry for existing installation and inserted a new entry on top. I may have understood completely wrong, so sorry about that. Anyway, if I turn my laptop on after that, it is immediately going to the following page:
 
So, I am not getting a chance to log in to Windows easily. While turning on the laptop, I have to press F12 to go to boot settings and from that Windows option is coming. This is just an inconvenience, which I am happy to ignore for now.
 
In general running a linux system sometimes requires a little bit of reading, learning, trying and such. If you are not willing to do that from time to time it is probably not the best choice for you.
 
Emergency Boot Kit (formerly Emergency Boot CD) is a powerful toolset for data recovery and fixing unbootable computers. It is a self-contained bootable OS on USB thumbdrive with the following features:
 
In full version of Emergency Boot Kit fixed disks are writeable. It is highly recommended to check the demo version before buying full version to verify against every possible hardware incompatibilities.

I tried following this solution in post #6 but couldn't get it to work.
Probably because those cp commands didn't work and I manually mounted my /boot from my arch install to some random folder (/var/empty) and copied the files there.
 
If the ESP is at /boot/efi and /boot is a separate partition as well then make sure both have have fstab entries and are mounted before the next upgrade
Edit:
This assumes the bootloader is using the kernel under /boot
 
Am I right you have locally attached HDDs where UCS is running and booting from? You just add your additional USB box to the computer, right? How is it going when you just attach the USB box without creating a RAID? Can you access all five (?) disks?
 
Upon hitting ctrl-d, I can see that the drive /dev/sdb1 is not mounted. That drive is normally mounted as /home. If I manually mount it there and continue booting up, everything runs fine. If I then reboot the computer though, I get the same issue.
 
Can anyone suggest/explain what the cause of this is? It apparently occurred when moving it to a new town. I didn't check much physically, just that the drives are secured properly and still properly connected. Any help would be very much appreciated.
 
I have the same issue, I assume the latest version of mkinitcpio has a bad bug. What makes matters worse is that I am on a 12 hour train ride and I need my laptop for work, and I don't have access to a recovery usb...
 
if you can get this far you should be able to proceed by exiting the emergency shell... unless that shell was pid 1 already, then you just exec /init or mount your rootfs to /new\_root and exec switch\_root /new\_root/sbin/init ... something like that?
 
Maybe another passenger on your train has one or could help you create one. Or you could use your phone with DriveDroid or similar app that lets you use the phone like a thumbdrive. But I've never tried that.
 
If /etc/crypttab or corresponding kernel parameters exist I think you should be able to "systemctl start systemd-cryptsetup@.service" from the emergency shell. Perhaps you can also "systemctl start cryptsetup.target" to have all devices encrypted, but I'm not sure if targets work this way.
 
But my guess is that the situation here is different... most likely a custom encrypt hook was being used (plymouth?), that hook vanished (now integrated in regular encrypt hook), as a result the custom hook is no longer included at all, so the initramfs was built without any cryptsetup support.
 
Hi,
for the first line the system works during about 3/4 minutes and give me the following error:

the second line, with recovery mode give me the same error but with more details during the start:

 
Hi
So at the other grub screen the one you posted earlier that has the SLES boot options (the four of them), this is where you edit and add the boot option init=/bin/bash have you tried this? Or is vmware skipping the option now?
 
When I installed the Zorin OS 15.3 Lite I completely forgot to create a partition, and the computer wasn't reading pendrives, which did prevent me to reinstall the OS... I think this might be related with the problem.

I think I didn't set up the file system correctly during installation - That's why I tried to do the recovery boot, but it just put me in a worse problem where the computer doesn't even leave this state
 
A torn tire body doesn't have to mean the end of a bike ride. The TB-2 Tire Boot is constructed from a strong, waterproof vinyl membrane with fiber weave reinforcement. A super-strong pressure-sensitive adhesive assures the boot stays in place in any bicycle tire that utilizes an inner tube, whether road or mountain, high or low pressure. Application is as easy as wiping the area clean, removing the backing, and squarely applying the tire boot to the affected area. A true ride saver.
 
Cycling Weekly: Best Puncture Repair Kits 2023The Park Tool TB-2 are quite large at 45mm x 75mm but I cut one down to roughly 45mm x 30mm to fit it into a 25c tyre. It stuck well (after thoroughly preparing the tyre) and it held well throughout the test.
 
Its good to use same boot disk software(same as system software) for making a boot disk, You can easily do it with Access my machine. Most of the 840 dsl machine will boot with all the boot disk software,
 
The main problem is that I can not do any nixos-rebuild in the terminal of systemd emergeny as the network seems not working. Also most of the files that could be edited, potentially, to solve the issue are read-only. So, I have no idea on how to have the system working again.
 
It was not possible to change manually /etc/fstab, or use any systemd method to mask a specific target unit. The only good point is that the utilities to format partitions like mkfs.ext4 and those to change levels, like for example e2label, are working (in the systemd emergency terminal) so the problem was solved just by creating a partition in a disk with the label that the systemd is looking for (by the local-fs.target)
 
In this case it was lucky that the configuration has been done with /dev/disk/by-label/ as that allowed to define a partition with the old label and the system could boot. This solution is not general and in cases where the filesystem in hardware-configuration.nix is not defined by label it would more tricky to solve the issue.
 
Instead of corrupting the Nix store, people may use runtime unit files to override units by writing files to /run/systemd/system, eg.: systemctl mask --runtime foo.mount or systemctl edit --runtime foo.service
 
Despite many suggestions from helpful guys here, I found no permanent solution. In the end I migrated to a clean OMV6. This also causes some problems with UnionFS which I need to fix manually after every boot, but at least it runs.
 
Hello,
I have just installed Almalinux 9 (AlmaLinux-9.0-x86\_64-minimal.iso) in proxmox vm , everthing seems all right. But as I installed it in bare metal server(Lenovo SR550) , something wrong happened.
After minimal install and reboot, system stuck in emergency mode. From output, it seems like mistakes in loading lvm volume.
Anyone can help me resolv this? It stuck me one week,thanks.
 
That is a good point. I prefer my root tiny and then I mount additional volumes for services that do need space (e.g. database). Not as flexible as LVM, but separates core OS-files from data too. I also still use ext4 as it can shrink, unlike XFS.
 
(You probably have some other ELRepo mirror closer to you.)
If installer has no network, then image on USB is used. See Chapter 14. Updating drivers during installation Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 | Red Hat Customer Portal
 
I tend to (re)install with PXEboot, which allows setting custom boot options on a server for multiple machines, although latest CentOS 7 installs had to use removable media as those machines had NIC that does need driver from ELRepo.
 
One thing to test (but might break the system) is to remove the kmod-megaraid\_sas from already installed system. If the 5.14.0-70.17.1 can boot with its own megaraid\_sas module (which obviously has to be injected into initramfs after removal of kmod-package and before reboot), then the issue is only in 5.14.0-70.13.1.
 
I've been to one of their many EM courses (Kauai) and they are great, along with the monthly abstracts (better than the Stanford EM course, at least back in the 90's). J. Hoffman has me questioning anything I hear or read now after approximately 15 years of subscribing to their abstracts and as a result, I now subscribe to his and R. Bukata's premise that in most cases, the less we treat the better off the patient usually is.
