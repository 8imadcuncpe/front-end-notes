Between 1900 and 1910, makeup may have still been a taboo subject, but most women did something to enhance their personal beauty. Staining lips, rouging cheeks, and powdering skin were performed by most young women on a daily basis.
 
The reasons for wearing makeup was not necessarily about advancing feminisms. Advertisers and editorial commentary of the day suggested women choose to wear makeup as a personally responsibility of their sex to be beautiful, to keep men from having affairs with younger women, and career advancement. A nice looking girl was more likely to get and keep a job as a receptionist, typist, or secretary.

Face powders were sold in three basic shades: white or ivory, pink or flesh, and brunette or olive called rachel. Pure white was very trendy but made women look like ghosts. Adding pink helped achieve some depth to fair skin. Most modern face powders and foundation tend to have a yellow cast.
 
Most face powders were made from rice powder, milk of magnesia, French chalk or venetian talc. Unfortunately, many contained toxic lead, arsenic and bismuth. Commercial cosmetics used dried potatoes and nuts to thicken powders without the toxins.
 
Face powder was stored in loose tins. Some were pressed into portable compacts with mini puff and mirror for on the go touch ups. Many powders were tinted with light fragrances of violet or rose. My grand mothers powder from the 1920s smells absolutely divine!
 
It was advised to apply a cold cream or face lotion first, wipe away excess and then dust with the powder using a puff. Powder was applied to the face, neck and chest. Talcum powder could be used on other parts of the body for freshness and aiding in dryness under arms.

Tip: For your foundation, choose a loose powder that is one step lighter than skin tone with pinkish undertones. I would avoid liquid foundations and powders that have a yellow or beige tint. The purpose of powder is to reduce shine, not to create a mask of uniform color.
 
Red rouge was sold to theater actors and actresses for years before they were remarked to the masses. Theater rouge was a cake of sticky red grease. Rouge for ladies was a small liquid bottle that was light enough to add a red stain to lips, cheeks and finger nails. Applying rouge to fingers helped them look young and healthy although rarely seen under gloves.
 
Rouge coverage was ample and rosy. Red checks looked youthful when covered in rouge from the outer temples across the apples to the nose then down to the outer lip. Rouge closer to the nose made faces look younger while further out was a better for already young faces. Mature ladies would avoid too much rouge otherwise they tended to look unnatural.
 
Liquid or cream rouge was applied to the lips. It acted like a Beetroot stain which many women continued to use at home. Later in the 1910s tubes of cream rouge became the first lipsticks, available in very limited light and dark pink-red tones.
 
Lip color was applied to the natural lips. Most illustrations showed women with pouted or kissy lips under the nose and very thin outer lines. On real faces women would line the center and avoid the outer edges to emphasize a small pouty lip.
 
Prior to the to brow pencil women used home remedies to make eyebrow powders and eye liners. Smashing cloves or burning cork into dust and mixing with a spec of water or Vaseline was one timeless method. The mixture was then applied with the fingers and rubbed in to the hair.
 
Mascara was not invented yet however China ink mixed with rose water was another home remedy to darken and lengthen eyelashes. It could be used on black eyebrows. Otherwise women use eyebrow pencils on lash lines too.
 
Eye shadow as we know it today was not invented yet however many women used the same crushed cloves or burnt cork to rub along the lower eyelid. From the theater women used colored crayons in shades of black, browns, chestnut, blonde and blues to deepen the eyeline.
 
The products above are all reproductions from LBCC except for a bit of Bare Minerals powder and a modern eyebrow pencil. I used a white face powder (seriously its very white), burnt cloves, and liquid rouge. I will also pull ins some of my Besame vintage makeup if I need a stronger look.
 
4. The next step was the eyebrows. I used the burn cloves to color them in. They worked but it was taking a long time and several cloves to cover one eyebrow. I then used my modern eyebrow pencil in brown to fill in the rest. If find that If I lift my eyebrows and then draw over the top hairline it creates a good strong arch. This looked perfect in person but did not photograph very well.

**Cosmetics** are composed of mixtures of chemical compounds derived from either natural sources or synthetically created ones.[1] Cosmetics have various purposes, including personal and skin care. They can also be used to conceal blemishes and enhance natural features (such as the eyebrows and eyelashes). Makeup can also add colour to a person's face, or change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object.[2]
 
Some early forms of cosmetics used harmful ingredients such as lead that caused serious health problems and sometimes resulted in death. Modern commercial cosmetics are generally tested for safety but may contain controversial ingredients, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), formaldehyde releasers, and ingredients that cause allergic reactions.
 
The European Union and regulatory agencies around the world have stringent regulations for cosmetics. In the United States, cosmetic products and ingredients do not requre FDA approval. Some countries have banned using animals for cosmetic testing.
 
Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries is broader, in some Western countries, cosmetics are commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as lipstick, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, blush, highlighter, bronzer, and several other product types.[*clarification needed*]
 
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates cosmetics,[5] defines cosmetics as products "intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions." This broad definition includes any material intended for use as an ingredient in a cosmetic product, with the FDA specifically excluding pure soap from this category.[6]
 
Cosmetics designed for skin care may be used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin, as well as replenish it, through the use of body lotions, cleansers, toners, serums, moisturizers, eye creams, retinol, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general personal care, such as shampoo, soap, and body wash, can be used to clean the body.
 
Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features, or add color to a person's face. In some cases, more extreme forms of makeup are used for performances, fashion shows, and people in costume and can change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature, or object. Techniques for changing appearance include contouring, which aims to give shape to an area of the face.
 
Historically, the absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific knowledge regarding the effects of various compounds on the human body for much of this time period, led to a number of negative effects upon those who used cosmetics, including deformities, blindness, and, in some cases, death. Although harmless products were used, such as berries, and beetroot, many cosmetic products available at this time were still chemically dubious and even poisonous. Examples of the prevalent usage of harmful cosmetics include the use of ceruse (white lead) throughout a number of different cultures, such as during the Renaissance in the West, and blindness caused by the mascara Lash Lure during the early 20th century. During the 19th century, there was a high number of incidents of lead poisoning due to the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder, leading to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and blackened skin, with heavy use known to lead to death.[10] Usage of white lead was not confined only to the West, with the white Japanese face makeup known as oshiroi also produced using white lead. In the second part of the 19th century, scientific advances in the production of makeup lead to the creation of makeup free of hazardous substances such as lead.[*citation needed*]
 
Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, changes in the prevailing attitudes towards cosmetics led to a wider expansion of the cosmetics industry. In 1882, English actress and socialite Lillie Langtry became the poster girl for Pears of London, making her the first celebrity to endorse a commercial product.[11] She allowed her name to be used on face powders and skin products.[12] During the 1910s, the market in the US was developed by figures such as Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, and Max Factor.
