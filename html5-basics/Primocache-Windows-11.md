The solid timber frames are bespoke made and finished by hand to ensure the highest quality finish to cut and grain. The windows are created from either Oak or Pine to create a lasting window with a classic design. The timber can then be finished in a range of semi-transparent stains, designed to allow the natural texture of the timber to be visible. Alternatively, you can choose to paint the frames in a range of water-based paints.
 
Wood is a natural insulator, so these timber double glazed windows are the perfect option for projects wishing to improve insulation levels. The Primo window is designed for both double and triple glazing. Even when using a typical DGU, the timber window offers Uw values from 1.1 W.m2K. Improved thermal values can be achieved with a TGU which provides Uw values of 0.86 W/m2K upwards.
 
Whether you are choosing a timber double glazed window for the performance, classical design or character of material, the Primo window offers a simple and effective way to create a bespoke timber window opening.
 
The Avino Primo range has the option to have the timber frame visible inside and out. Thanks to the unique aluminium glazing bead on the outside, you can choose to expose the beauty of the timber frame outside as well as in.

The timber frame of the Primo timber window is available in Pine or Oak. These timbers are then available in a range of finishes to suit the project. Thanks to the aluminium glazing bead, this timber finish is the same on the outside.
 
Finger jointing or cross lamination are the two most popular ways to work with timber to improve its strength. You can find out about the differences between cross lamination and finger jointed timber here.

**PRIMO** windows will surprise you with simplicity that places functionality and design first. When creating WIŚNIOWSKI windows, our designers and engineers primarily thought about what each home needs. We know how important the sense of security and reliability is. It remained our priority throughout the long process of designing the **PRIMO** windows. All the functional advantages of our PVC windows are highlighted by their state-of-the-art design, the simplicity and elegance of which will be a joy to look at for many years to come.

**PRIMO** is the result of three decades of experience and efforts to create perfect windows.
 
We pay a great deal of attention to functionality, but also to the appearance of our products, which is why we weld PVC windows in a way that results in a barely noticeable joint. This makes it possible to obtain the effect of a perfect bond, which cannot be achieved using any other technology.

 
The PRIMO window design is based on minimalism and attention to detail. The profile cores of the PRIMO windows are through-coloured in 4 colours. Depending on the window type, we provide profiles in: anthracite, brown, caramel, and white.
Additionally, in the case of the PRIMO 70 window with colour on one side, the following profile colours are available: white-caramel, white-brown, and white. This is all to minimize the risk of scratches on the film coated windows.

 
For door and window renovation, PRIMO maintenance-free glazing beads are an effective solution that extends the life span of your wooden windows. The glazing beads are made of plastic that resists all kinds of weather influence and does not absorb water or become dry in the same way as a wooden moulding.
This way you avoid moisture, damp and fungus related damage. PRIMO glazing beads are available in 4 different types and sizes.
