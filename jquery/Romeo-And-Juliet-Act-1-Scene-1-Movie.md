It may be a bit of an exaggeration to say that the Capulet garden scene inRomeo and Juliet is the most famous in literature, but it isdefinitely well-known. I think the reason for this is that the storyitself is compelling, because of the forbidden love. Also, the languageis beautiful and perfectly captures young love.
 
One the most interesting things about this scene is that it really only saysthat Juliet is at a window. She is usually given a balcony so that shecan actually move around. There is limited movement at a window. Also, Romeo could see her better on a balcony. I think there is somethinginherently romantic about balconies, anyway.

Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? (Act 2, Scene2)

Act II, Scene 2 of Romeo and Juliet creates for readers andlisteners those intensely poetic, deliciously romantic, delightfullyemotionally stirring moments in which the audience is both fascinated by theexquisite language of the verse and moved themselves as they hear/read thewords of young, bare emotion and sensuality.

In addition, at the beginning of the scene, Juliet appears above Romeo, andshe does not realize that Romeo is present in the orchard. Therefore, shespeaks candidly, and says, for example, that Romeo would be as beloved to herwith another name. The lovers' determination to overcome the challenges thatseparate them paints a hopeful picture that glorifies love's ability to bridgedifferences.

Oh, what an interesting and challenging question! What is ironic aboutthis scene is that, while it is known as a famous love scene, it is reallyabout the infatuation of two young teenagers, run away with theiremotions.
 
Romeo goes on from here to praise Juliet with metaphors and imagery thatestablish her as the center of her universe. He shows the tender emotionsof fear and uncertainty, wanting to speak to her but afraid she will notrespond.
 
When Juliet does respond, the two lovers quickly establish an equalfooting. Romeo praises her with poetic language about his love and herdeserving qualities. Juliet both tempers his language and praises himwith her insistence that he - and nothing else in the universe - is the mostvaluable thing by which to promise his love.
 
The feelings of first love, the passion of new love, are all bound up inthis scene. They are feelings that most readers can connect with and havefond memories of. Shakespeare catches the intensity of the emotion andthe high spirits that accompany it in the language of the two. That iswhat makes it so popular.
