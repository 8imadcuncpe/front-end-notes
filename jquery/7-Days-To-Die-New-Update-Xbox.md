Even bringing my xbox when traveling just to make sure I got my daily log-in. Well, my effort earned me a "Veteran" decal. Thought there was something special but just a decal. Oh well, I'm not going to waste the effort going for the 1 year, 2 year, or even 5 year Veteran decal of that's all you get.
 
It's such a pain though, there were a number of times that I almost didn't make it with xbox updates and game updates coming out at the same time, and with working a full time job on top of still being enlisted in the National Guard. Making it for a full year is impossible for me. I have a 3 week field exercise in the summer and in a few weeks a 4 day field exercise. Can't bring my xbox out to those.

Last week, it was mentioned by the **7 Days To Die** team that they were targeting a July 25th launch for the 1.0 version of the game on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and now that date (which is today!) is officially set in stone.
 
When it arrives in a few hours' time, 7 Days To Die 1.0 will offer a significantly improved experience compared to the old Xbox One version of 7 Days To Die, which was a heavily stripped back version that's now been officially delisted.
 
"This milestone release heralds a groundbreaking evolution in the survival horror genre, packed with new a wealth of new content, innovative new features, polish, transformative quality-of-life improvements, optimizations, and revolutionary gameplay systems.

If you already own the digital Xbox One version of 7 Days To Die, you can get a discount on the 1.0 version for Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. This allows you a 25% reduction on the launch price of $44.99.
 
Discounts will only remain available for 30 days, so be sure to take advantage if you're interested. It's also mentioned that you may not see the discount immediately at launch - it will be available "after Microsoft makes the discount live sometime during the business hours of the 25th". So yeah... don't go paying more than you need to!

We'll throw more details about 7 Days To Die 1.0's Xbox version down below, along with screenshots. Keep in mind there are a few differences compared to the PC version at launch - these are documented in the 7 Days To Die FAQ.
 
"Our plan is to give the console edition owners every free update that the PC version gets, keeping parity with PC for Crossplay. If a feature is not technically possible due to hardware restrictions, or is otherwise restricted by certification requirements set by Microsoft or Sony, it will not make it to the console edition."
 
As an avid gamer, you may have wondered "is 7 days to die cross platform?" The answer is not as straightforward as one might hope. This article will look into the complexities of this popular game and its ability to be played across different platforms.
 
We'll begin by exploring the mechanics of '7 Days To Die', a game that revolves around crafting and survival in a hostile environment. You'll learn about the progression system, from basic wood-based structures to advanced metal fortifications.
 
In the world of 7 Days to Die, players scavenge for resources and farm their own food while trying to stay alive amidst a zombie apocalypse. The game revolves around building bases equipped with traps - starting off with simple wooden structures before progressing towards stronger metal fortifications as you gather more materials and level up your skills.
 
The challenge lies not just in surviving but also managing resources effectively - everything from food and water supplies down to ammunition for weapons needs careful consideration. It's an intense experience that tests both strategic thinking and reflexes alike.
 
This PC version of the game offers compatibility across various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS and Linux, as well as cross-platform play and crossplay options. However, console versions available on Xbox Marketplace or PS5 console have certain limitations when compared against their PC counterparts due to differences in gaming platforms' capabilities.
 
Despite these differences, the game still enables gamers to play together across multiple platforms through cross-platform and crossplay options. This feature is becoming increasingly important in today's interconnected digital landscape where gamers expect seamless experiences irrespective of the device used.
 
As the gaming world evolves, **cross-platform play** is becoming increasingly popular. This innovative feature allows gamers to enjoy their favorite titles, such as "7 Days to Die," across multiple platforms. Whether you're a PC player or console enthusiast, cross-platform compatibility breaks down barriers and brings players together.
 
Cross-platform gaming enables players on different devices to interact with each other in the same game environment. The primary benefit is flexibility - it doesn't matter if your friend has an Xbox while you own a PS5 console; both can play "7 Days to Die" together. It also expands potential multiplayer pools, making matchmaking quicker and more diverse.
 
Despite these advantages, not all games offer cross-platform play due to technical challenges or licensing issues. For instance, popular games like Fallout 4 do not support this feature yet. Additionally, even for those that do allow it (like "7 Days to Die"), full functionality may not be available across all systems - especially between PC versions and consoles from the Xbox Marketplace or PlayStation Store.
 
The console versions of "7 Days to Die" for PS4 and Xbox One offer limited multiplayer gaming, only allowing players using the same type of console. However, this is limited to players using the same type of console. Players with Xbox Ones are limited to interacting only with other gamers on the same console.
 
Unfortunately, cross-platform play between consoles and PCs is currently not supported in "7 Days to Die", limiting the potential of multiplayer gameplay. Sadly, there's no way for both of you to survive the zombie-filled universe if one has a PC version while the other owns a console variant.
 
In essence, while "7 Days to Die" does offer a form of multiplayer gameplay amongst similar gaming platforms like either PS4 or Xbox One users exclusively, it doesn't quite live up to its full potential due to the lack of complete cross-platform compatibility as seen in games like Fallout 4.
 
The closure of Telltale Games in 2018 had a significant impact on the console version of '7 Days to Die'. This unfortunate event led to complications with publishing and updates, which may have affected its cross-platform compatibility.
 
Despite these setbacks, The Fun Pimps - the game's original creators - continued their work. They initially launched '7 Days to Die' as an early access title on the Steam marketplace, focusing primarily on PC players. Their dedication has allowed for regular updates and improvements that keep the gaming community engaged.
 
This also highlights one key difference between PC and console versions: while PC users receive frequent updates directly from The Fun Pimps, console gamers must wait for official releases via PlayStation or Xbox marketplaces. This discrepancy could be another reason why full crossplay isn't currently available in '7 Days to Die'.
 
Players are hoping that '7 Days to Die' will provide cross-platform capabilities, considering the current trend of cross-gaming. While it's not currently available, The Fun Pimps' commitment to improving the game's cross-platform nature gives hope for the future.
 
So, don't let the game die cross-platform - stay alive on multiple gaming platforms with cross-platform compatibility. And who knows, maybe one day we'll see '7 Days to Die' offer cross-platform play on all consoles, including the PS5 console.
 
Currently, 'Seven Days to Die' does not offer cross-platform play, but there's a glimmer of hope for the future. Developers have hinted at potential improvements that could make the game cross-platform compatible. No timeline has yet been revealed for these updates.
 
The game's developers have made several posts on their official forums suggesting they're exploring options for full cross-platform gaming. This means that in the future, we might see PS4 players being able to join forces with PC players and vice versa. It would certainly add an exciting new dimension to this video game if it were possible to stay alive together regardless of your preferred gaming platforms.
 
Apart from the possibility of enabling cross-play, another hint dropped by developers is about next-gen releases like Xbox Series X/S and PS5 console versions. They've suggested a fresh launch with updated graphics and improved performance which could potentially include cross-platform compatibility. It appears that Fun Pimps Entertainment is eager to widen their player base by embracing multiple platforms.
