There are numerous **add-ons** each with their own aims and purposes. Some smaller add-ons add things such as seasons or achievements, while others are complete interface overhauls, and there are even a few cheat add-ons.

Note: Add-ons which names are in *italics* using a modding framework known as Cookie Clicker Script Extender (CCSE). These add-ons should be loaded in **before** Cookie Monster (see "Overhaul Add-ons" section). Failure to do so will cause Cookie Clicker to freeze, rendering the game unplayable.
 
Tampermonkey is a Userscript Database Manager that can be used to install and track all Cookie Clicker Add-ons, as all add-ons are scripts. Tampermonkey can be found here and has browser extensions for all popular web browsers. Alternative Userscript Managers, such as Greasemonkey, will also work for Cookie Clicker add-ons.

Cookie Monster is a useful and complex JavaScript add-on that can be implemented into Cookie Clicker. This add-on is for displaying calculated data to help make purchasing that next Building or Upgrade a bit easier to decide. With many helpful tools, it is an add-on to make Cookie Clicker less stressful.
 
Everything that doesn't earn you a direct bonus to your income will display as gray. This means that upgrades such as the various mouses, Golden Cookie frequency upgrades, or the like, will not be rated; but they will be rated if purchasing grants milk. Such upgrades will require manual evaluation on their worth.
 
If you'd rather use the add-on as a script via per example *Greasemonkey* or *Tampermonkey*, you can use the following script, which will automatically load *Cookie Monster* every time the original game loads. You may need to specify when asked for a *namespace* or *includes*. For how to add an userscript to your browser, refer to your browser/plugin's documentation as the method changes for each one.
 
Go to \_bookmarklet\_loader.js and copy/paste the text of the website into a bookmark or into the browser console. Frozen Cookies can also be found on the Steam Workshop.If a bookmark was created, load up Cookie Clicker and load the bookmark you created whilst focused on Cookie Clicker.
 
A replacer for the outdated Agronomicon. It does everything that Agronomicon does. Also includes a simple autoharvest and a few cheat options that are easily disabled in the "Options" menu if desired.
 
Simple script that helps passive players with the **stock market** minigame by displaying the Resting Value (the price a stock tends to over time) and the Current Stock Value/Resting Value in percentage form (if the price of the stock = resting value of the stock then percentage = 100%, if its undervalued then percentage is
 
A script used to automate Stock Market trading. It can be used to set an auto buy and sell price for all stocks. It also tracks the historical lows and highs give approximate trading values. A useful Add-On for idling achievement hunters.
 
This script uses an algorithm based on looking at the changes of each stock's mode, unlike other scripts operating like real trading bots. This makes it more effective than both real bots and other scripts mimicing their algorithms.
 
This add-on contains two parts: the dataset, which is a histogram of the stock values in the stock market, collected in a simulation of 1000 years of the market ups and downs; and the statistics display, which shows the histogram and the quantiles of the current stock values.
 
Fortune Cookie is an add-on which shows the outcomes of all of the Grimoire spells. It it most useful for the Force the Hand of Fate spell, making it easy to combo Golden Cookie effects. It is also useful for farming Sugar Lumps with the "Sweet" Golden Cookie, which can be seen with the Force the Hand of Fate planner. In the options menu, there is a slider which lets the player set how many spells they want to predict, going up to 100 spells to be predicted.
 
Lightweight script that runs in the background with no user interface, can be edited at will. Auto clicks the big cookie (boosts cookie production up to 850%!), auto pops non-shiny wrinklers, auto clicks golden (but not wrath) cookies, and auto clicks reindeers. To install, paste it into Tampermonkey.
 
Spiritual successor to Cookie Clicker Helper, now loads multiple popular plugins at once including Cookie Monster, CookiStocker, and Cookie Garden Helper. Press X on your keyboard to toggle the autoclicker, as with it on it is very hard to click on the Santa or Krumblor. Under the right circumstances, such as a Dragonflight, it can boost your CpS by over 1800%, which combined with the automatization of the stock market will bring insane profits.
 
Heavenly Calculator is an application to help you with your prestiges. It can calculate the amount of Heavenly Chips you will get when reset, and the amount of Cookies needed to earn a certain number of Heavenly Chips.
 
With over 40,000 reviews and over 95 percent of players coming away with a positive experience, it's impossible to deny that Cookie Clicker is a cult classic for idle game enthusiasts. Given the nature of the genre, it's easy to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours on the game.
 
Alas, novelty tends to be a finite and fleeting phenomenon; at some point, you'll need something new to keep your attention. If the game is starting to feel a bit dry, and your eyes are starting to glaze over from seeing your 537th golden cookie event, these awesome mods can help breathe some life into your current playthrough.
 
**Updated January 13, 2024, by Jack Pierik:** Hopefully your cookie empire has been going through limitless, time-warping, insurmountable expansion. Although, it's not a huge deal if that's not the case; time is obviously on your side, given the nature of Idle games in general. In this update, we're adding three add-ons, two of which bring assets or references from immensely popular Indie and Anime titles, as well as one that makes progression a bit easier for those of you with plenty of playtime and experience. With that said, go ahead and grab a cookie if you have some on hand, and dive into these wonderful, visual, and progress-related add-ons.
 
Stardew Valley is an incredibly cozy Indie title with lots of character and love put into it by the developer, Eric Barone. If you want to remind yourself of all the fun you had in that game, why not port over some happy Junimos and iconic NPCs into Cookie Clicker?
 
From re-textured buildings, funny changes to achievements, upgrades, and other text, and even catastrophic events related to Joja Corporation, what more could you need from a Stardew-themed add-on? If anything, it makes starting a new playthrough actually seem like a good idea.
 
If you're a big anime fan, it'd be almost impossible not to recognize the name Gojo or his iconic black headband and white spiked hair. If that's still not ringing a bell, this mod is based on a main character from Jujutsu Kaisen.
 
Admittedly, there's not much to this mod aside from making the cookie you click on look like Gojo, but for some of you, that'll be just enough fan service to get you to download it, and there's absolutely no shame in that; it's a great anime.
 
If you're a seasoned Cookie Clicker veteran with playthroughs easily lasting longer than 1,000 hours, it can be tiresome, tedious, or even unthinkable to start a new playthrough or feel compelled to continue a current one.
 
If you need a little nudge in the right direction, though, this mod makes normal "7x" cookies useless but, in exchange, will speed up your game by 700 percent; this might be the best trade deal in the history of trade deals. Don't spend all those cookies in one place.
 
Have you ever wanted to know **exactly** when the next on-screen event is going to appear? Are you tired of getting up to use the bathroom and coming back only to see that last golden cookie shrink and fade out of existence?
 
If so, workshop author mattklose has you covered with Timer Widget. If all went well with the installation, you'll find a handy widget titled "Timer" with multicolored bars at the bottom left of your screen displaying countdowns for various on-screen events.
 
If you've been playing for a while and gone through multiple ascensions, you're likely familiar with the time constraints of the game. In other words, even if you were to leave the game up every minute of every day with an auto clicker, you can only have so much growth over time. Thus, planning out future upgrades for when you get the exact amount of resources you need can be helpful.
 
Picture this: you can purchase the next upgrade you want in 2,220 seconds. If that time frame was difficult to imagine, workshop author claudz has you covered with Cookies Per Minute. Poof, that 2,220 seconds is now 37 minutes.
 
Being a cookie wizard can be good fun. Equipped with your trusty grimoire, it has never been a question of if you **can**cast a spell, but rather if it will **backfire** on you. Indeed, the unfortunate truth is that no spell comes without risk.
 
When it comes to the spell "Force the Hand of Fate," you'll usually be granted a golden cookie. If you're unlucky, you'll end up with a wrath cookie. If you've ever wanted to know what awaits you upon clicking that cookie, boba's Clairvoyance mod will let you know through a handy, highly legible interface.
 
From various colors and flavors of milk and cookies to nifty background patterns and designs, this game has an impressive variety of aesthetic customizations. There are, however, only so many options to choose from, and there's one customization that the base game doesn't let you change: **the big cookie**.
 
That's right, with 徐可莫 and G Lander's Perfect Cookie Selector mod, you can change the appearance of the giant cookie you've been clicking on this who
