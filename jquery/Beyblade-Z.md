hello, i have been practicing making different things with js react. I made this beyblade that spins so everyone can see. i want to add a counter that counts every rotation. Well, i actually want to make a button with with two different beyblades and they both generate a random number of spins. So when me and my friends are having a dispute i cant take it to the beyblade page and see whos top stops spinning first. im not sure if this makes sense, but i am still very much a beginner and i am not sure where to start. If anyone could help answer these questions it would be very much appreciated.
 
My son discovered the Beyblade Burst series on Netflix last year and quickly became fan. A friend of his had some blades already and he was able to give them a try. Needless to say that he quickly came back asking to get some to play with us.

We have spent a lot of hours battling against each other, cheering for our blade, trading parts, and learning strategies. 

It has become a daily routine. And guess what? My son is not the only fan anymore.
 
Season 1 of the anime is available on Netflix. It follows Valt a young passionate blader trying to reach the World League. 
The Beyblade burst toys are very close to the ones in the anime and have similar names.
 
It comes in several different shapes allowing for different outcomes. 
Ours, for instance, does have four pits in the corners where the blades could get bumped into, which is the other victory condition that attack beys would look for (other than bursting their opponent). The middle circle also has a slightly bumpy shape to force beys to move in the stadium, so even stamina or defense type would interact with their opponent.

 
Before every battle, you will need to assemble your beyblade, fixing the three components together.
Then you will get your launcher ready, by placing the ripcord into the launcher, putting the blade into the launcher and making sure it is softly locked (it does not fell off the launcher when you let it go).

 
This launch is a bit trickier than the banking one, as you will have to push your launcher forward while performing a banking launch. Your blade is going to gain more power and spin in a flower pattern. This is mainly for attack-type blades as they will be colliding way more often with the opponent blades.
 
This style is similar to the parallel launch but you will be pulling your ripcord slower than usual. Your beyblade will be slower and will move erratically which will make the battle way harder for attack-type opponents.
 
If you only get two blades, your games will most likely have the same outcome each battle and will make your experience a bit boring. So you should try to get a couple more, to give this game a real shot.

For now, the blades come in three versions (1, 2, and 3), with 3 being the newest. You do not need to have the latest version to enjoy the game. But if your kids want to battle their friends, they will quickly find out than a 
Spryzen S3 is way more powerful than a Spryzen S2 for instance. They will also understand that the best beyblade burst is a combination of existing beyblades.
 
You can find the special moves of the different beyblades in the corresponding series or video-games. Beyblade Burst is on Netflix and you will find some of the Beyblade Metal fusion on youtube.

Not having much luck on the UK either. TK maxx used to have one or two but usually from earlier collections.
We have tried Facebook marketplace for stadiums. Other than that, we order mostly online.
 
Beyblade was very popular in the early 2000s when it first came to the UK, the cartoon was on every day and all the kids used to collect them. I noticed that they are becoming popular with a new generation and found this site. They were a very fun toy and I have fond memories!
 
My son keeps asking for a Beyblade with a protector ring but I cannot find any info on this. Do you know what he is referring to? He said he had 2 (that came with different Beyblades) but they both broke. Any help you could give me would be appreciated!!
 
Hello!
No you can have battles with right spinning beys only.
It just adds to diversity, strategy and fun to have beys able to spin in different directions, as they do not behave the same way.
 
I have been beybladeing for a while now and i would like to share my knowledge of beyblades as well. Takara tomy is the stronger and original version of hasbro however on amazon they are slightly more expensive than hasbro. I joined a group called the world beyblade organization and they host tournements for all ages and have prizes for winning. there is even a ranking system which is pretty neat!
 
See all the beyblades work on all the stadiums properly but like for example an attack type like valtriyek would have advantage in a slingshot stadium as it would gain more power from the slides and if you talk about a stamina type like fafnier then a basic stadium would be most suitable for it
 
yo i have a team name TEAM WILDFLAME and im making a live action movie and my team are the star players if u wanna see its in progres but we cant find the right things if u wanna help just ask and we will do it

That is super cool. So, students have traditionally been advised against using AI in the case of violating academic integrity and plagiarism. Do you see more concerns with this in the new partnership?
 
Yeah the University will probably have a hard time walking the tightrope between academic integrity and AI. However, ASU does seem to think that AI will be a net positive for education with plans to create AI avatars to help students study for classes. It's an untested ground for universities and tech AI everything. So it's really hard to say right now if it's going to be positive or negative for ASU.
 
Seated in a small classroom on the ASU West Campus, are a small group of students ripping Beyblades, special plastic spinning tops that are spun using a special spin launcher that fits on top of each Beyblade. Players gather around the arena, or decagon, and launch their Beyblades at each other until the last one is left standing. The club is called the West Bladers Association. Junior ASU student and president of the West Bladers Association, James Kinney explains more.
 
It's a pretty relaxed club that just plays with Beyblades. We hold tournaments and we generally, just sometimes we watch the show, sometimes we watch tournaments that other people have and we just play with Beyblades. That's kind of branched out recently. Last semester we introduced other areas toys, like we have some Legos now. And some people play card games while they're there, and everyone has a chance to relax and just study if they want to. It was created by myself and three my roommates our freshman year to act as more of a social thing that we could connect on and that grew into our friends wanting to get in on it. So, we created the club and going from their home grown into its own thing.
 
Beyblades originated from a Japanese company called Takara in 1999. However, Beyblades began to garner international appeal after the release of the 2001 anime titled Beyblade. And the rest they say is history. Once international toy conglomerate Hasbro started manufacturing their own beyblades, every Toys R Us, Walmart and Target had their shelves stocked with Beys.
 
Yeah, a lot of the times in the show, especially, Beyblades are pretty like intense. Like they create a whirlwind and tornadoes and like they split seas and stuff. And even in real life people are lighting Beyblades on fire and like having them go against each other. And even the like competitive scene is pretty intense. But most people in the club know each other already, so it's more of a friendly competition thing.
 
Oh, yeah. We do a we do a bracket system, but not really with any seeding or anything. Most people are at the same skill level because of the same kind of level of interest that they have. It's a March Madness style bracket with single elimination. So like every round has three like battles in it and then whoever wins most there, they kind of move on. We don't really do a loser's bracket though, if we do is just to see who got third or fourth because otherwise it's just a little bit of a mess to go around.
 
The general atmosphere was very calm and personable. Even though we were all competing, everyone was having a good time. Above all, students like junior applied computing major, Noah Martin, who grew up on watching the Beyblade show, appreciate the engaging atmosphere at West Bladers.
 
I guess what makes the club just a really nice for me is just the engagement with everyone. It's fun playing a little bit Beyblades fun, messiness and Legos. And it's fun, just chilling out here with everybody. It's just a nice chill area to hang out, talk to some people, make some friends and just have fun.
