
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) manifests in childhood with symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention. In addition, there are other secondary symptoms associated with ADHD such as insomnia, learning disabilities, and delayed language development. The symptoms affect cognitive, academic, behavioural, emotional and social functioning. ADHD is found to be more common in boys than girls. It often continues into adolescence and adulthood. If left untreated, it leaves millions of children and adults incapacitated causing a lifetime of frustrated dreams and emotional pain.

Attention Deficit Disorder in children may result from over-stimulation of senses from the environmental pollutants of the modern world. They are exposed to myriad toxins through air, water and food now-a-days. It may also result from Beej Dushti during conception or Garbhaja Kaaranas (causes in the prenatal period). Vata dosha is a combination of aakash and vaayu mahabhoot, because of which, it is the most unstable dosha and also causes imbalance in other doshas, Kapha and Pitta. In the case of hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder, there is vitiation of vayu and akash mahabhoot guna and suppression of pruthvi mahabhoot qualities. Hence, from the perspective of Ayurveda, ADHD is a condition of increased expansive and creative energies and decreased stability. To treat the symptoms of ADHD, Ayurveda seeks to counterbalance the unstable elemental forces of akaash and vayu by increasing the stability factor of pruthvi mahabhoot.
 
To treat ADHD, Ayurveda utilizes a large spectrum of herbal remedies to address neurological disorders and establish balance of dosha and dhatus. The treatments include cleansing of Aam , that has built up in the body and even the mind; building healthy levels of Ojas (Vital energy) is the key to maintain a healthy mind, nervous system and body.

Ayurvedic rejuvenation therapies that will treat Vata both in the mind and nervous system are given, to cleanse aam and rebuild ojas. Panchakarma procedures like Abhyanga, Nasya, Shirodhara, oil pichu dharan, Shirobasti, etc. are given depending upon the prakriti and dosha avastha of the child.
 
A child with ADHD needs regularity and consistency to counter his/her natural tendency towards chaos; regularity of sleep patterns, eating patterns, and avoiding anything that disrupts or over stimulates the senses is recommended. Steady routines stabilize Vata and negates the ill effects that irregularity causes.
