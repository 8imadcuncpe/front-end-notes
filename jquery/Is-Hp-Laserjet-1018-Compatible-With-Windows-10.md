Only the Windows Built-in Print Driver is compatible with the HP LaserJet 1018 on Windows 10. Below, I have posted a link to a document that offers some instructions on how to install and use the Windows Built-in Print Driver. Please try out all of the steps, in order and get back to me with the results.

To fix this, just download 7-zip for free and after you install it right-click on the downloaded HP driver package and select **Extract to** or **Extract here** commands from the pop-up menu.
 
Thank you so much, Nik ! Same comment as Stefff ? and like Aitiguy it worked straight away, nothing else was required. I just plug my HP 1018, restarted word, it recognized the printer and i could print out with my new acer.
 
I had just changed machines where was previously running my old HP laserjet 1018 under win 10 64 bit with I believe a driver for win 7.1 or 8.1 but could not find a solution for my new computer (lenovo) Mar 2020. Ttied everywhere and unsuccessful until I found Wincert.net. Thanks so much. worked immediately after 2 min d/L and install.
 
Still working great. Thank you Nik for this. Like others, the Win 10 install indicated it was done automatically, but nothing in printers and drivers. I had tried several HP drivers and all had failed to find the printer or kacked on installation

I had a laserjet 1018 from my PC days and wanted to have it work directly with my MacBook Pro. Up until now I used the Laserjet 1018 with VMware fusion to print from a virtual PC running windows XP Pro.
 
Thanks, worked perfectly. Was convinced I was never going to get use of the 1018 again once I finally removed the Windows PC from my set-up. Had the Mac for three years and spent a lot of time (unsuccessfully) trying to find drivers to use the 1018 with OSX. This workaround was a much appreciated find! Thanks immensely.
 
During the 2000's and early '10's I worked in various IT departments. I still experience a small shiver down my spine and get a twitch in my eye when reminiscing about my days in corporate IT trying to give various network service support to my macOS clients in a Microsoft Windows-dominated world.
 
While most services on macOS had analogues for their Windows counterparts, printing on the big copier/printer/scanner machines proved much more tasking. Sure postscript might work depending on the copier (and that thanks was owed to CUPS from the open source world) but for our very few Mac users, printing onto machines designed to only work for Windows clients (our CFO found them to be much cheaper) was quite trying. But we managed it, and that's because regardless of what special features or doodads a printer may have, the underlying mechanism and functions are all the same. It's using this same principle that just might help you get your printer to work under macOS.
 
Today with AirPrint and more ubiquitous macOS support you can just about print to any printer you can buy on the market. However, there still exist some printers that support Windows only clients. I for example have an older HP 1018 printer of which there is no official macOS support. But fret not! You just might be able to find a printer driver that is "close enough" for your printer to make it recognized on macOS. Here's how I got my HP 1018 laserjet printer to work.
 
Luckily for us, HP tends to name it's various printers with similar feature sets with similar model numbers. So, for example, since I have an HP laserjet 1018 printer, I know that a similarly named HP laserjet like the HP laserjet 1010 or the HP laserjet 1022 may share some features with my 1018. So we try to find a best match by iteration until we get the features we absolutely want to work. Note that you may just only get printing working but extra features like duplexing or scanning might not function. But at least you can print. These instructions assume your printer is powered up and connected as expected by the manufacturer.
 
As with any hack, success with this "close enough" strategy will vary by printer and by manufacturer. I also have to live with ignoring some the of the options that come with the 1022 that don't exist on my 1018 in the print dialogs when I print something. No matter. Working printer. Or, you can just buy a Mac supported printer like the HP laserjet 1022. What about you? Have a hack or tweak you want to mention? Lets know in the comments!
 
**LaserJet** as a brand name identifies the line of laser printers marketed by the American computer company Hewlett-Packard (HP). The HP LaserJet was the world's first commercially successful laser printer.[1] Canon supplies both mechanisms and cartridges for most HP laser printers; some larger A3 models use Samsung print engines.[2][3]
 
Most HP LaserJet printers employ xerographic laser-marking engines sourced from the Japanese company Canon. Due to a very tight turnaround schedule on the first HP LaserJet, HP elected to use the controller already developed by Canon for the CX engine in the first HP LaserJet.[6] In spring of 1989 *The New York Times* said that HP "dominates" the PC laser printer market.[7]
 
The first HP LaserJet and the first Apple LaserWriter used the same print engine, the Canon CX engine.[8] HP chose to use their in-house developed Printer Command Language (PCL) as opposed to Apple, which adopted the PostScript language, as developed by Adobe Systems. The use of a less-ambitious and simpler Page description language allowed HP to deliver its LaserJet to the market about a year before Apple's CX based product, and for $1000 less.[6] The sharing of an identical Canon engine in two competing products continued with the HP LaserJet II/III and the Apple LaserWriter II, which both used the Canon LBP-SX print engine.
 
HP introduced the first laser printer for IBM PC compatible personal computers in May 1984 at the Computer Dealers' Exhibition (COMDEX). It was a 300-dpi, 8 ppm printer that sold for $3,495 with the price reduced to $2,995 in September 1985.[6] It used an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 processor and could print in a variety of character fonts.[1] It was controlled using PCL3. Due to the high cost of memory, the first LaserJet only had 128 kilobytes of memory, and a portion of that was reserved for use by the controller.
 
The HP LaserJet printer had high print quality, could print horizontally or vertically and produce graphics.[1] It was ideal for printing memos, letters, and spreadsheets. It was quiet compared to other contemporary printers, hence people could use the telephone while sitting near the HP LaserJet.[1]
 
The first LaserJet was a high-speed replacement for text-only daisy wheel impact printers and the noisy dot matrix printers. By using control codes it was possible to change the printed text style using font patterns stored in permanent ROM in the printer. Although unsupported by HP, because the Laserjet used the same basic PCL language (PCL Level III)[8] spoken by HP's other printers it was possible to use the Laserjet on HP 3000 multiuser systems.
 
The LaserJet Plus followed in September 1985, priced at US$3,995.[6] It introduced "soft fonts", treatments like bold and italic and other features including a parallel (Centronics) interface. It also included 512 kilobytes of memory, which was sufficient to print graphics at 300 dpi that covered about 70% of the letter-size page area.
 
The HP LaserJet IID was released in the fall of 1988, It was the first desktop laser printer capable of duplexing.[6] It was also the first HP LaserJet with an HP-designed and manufactured formatter.[6]
 
In September 1989, HP introduced the first "personal" version of the HP LaserJet printer series, the LaserJet IIP.[7] Priced at US$1,495 by HP, and half the size and price of its predecessor, the LaserJet II, it offered 300-dpi output and 4 ppm printing with PCL 4 enhancements such as support for compressed bitmapped fonts and raster images. It was also the first **no ozone** print engine.[6] Retailers predicted a street price of $1000 or less, making it the world's first sub-$1,000 laser printer. The LaserJet IIP (and its very similar successor, the IIIP) were reliable.[9]
 
In March 1990 HP introduced the LaserJet III, priced at US$2,395, with two new features: Resolution Enhancement technology (REt), which dramatically increased print quality, and HP PCL 5.[6] Thanks to PCL 5, text scaling became easy, and thus customers were no longer restricted to 10- and 12-point type sizes. This had a dramatic effect on word processing software market.
 
The first mass-market Ethernet network printer, the HP LaserJet IIISi, debuted in March 1991. Priced at $5,495, it featured a high-speed, 17 ppm engine, 5MB of memory, 300-dpi output, Image REt and such paper handling features as job stacking and optional duplex printing. The LaserJet IIISi also was HP's first printer to offer onboard Adobe PostScript emulation as opposed to the font-cartridge solution offered on earlier models.[10]
 
In October 1992, HP introduced the LaserJet 4 featuring a Canon EX engine with native 600-dpi output and Microfine toner for US$2,199. This model also introduced TrueType fonts to LaserJets which ensured that the printer fonts exactly matched the fonts displayed on the computer screen. (TrueType fonts could print on an original LaserJet Plus or later, but they would be printed as graphics, making the printing slow and restricted to a limited page area or reduced resolution.)[6] Some competitors also utilized the Canon EX engine, including Apple (LaserWriter Pro 600 and 630), Digital Equipment Corporation (DEClaser 5100), and Canon.[11][12]
