When the code is entered, the phone might show phone information, battery information, or do something that the secret code is programmed to do so. Moreover, The secret code is also used to troubleshoot problems or access hidden menus, which are typically not present on phones and designed to perform specific tasks.

Some Secret codes are general and can be used by anyone. However, phone manufacturer service centres usually use the USSD codes to access phone information or troubleshoot problems from the hidden menu. Below we have listed all essential Secret Codes for Motorola Phones.
 
Motorola is now officially owned by Lenovo, and all phones are majorly on Android, so most of the old Motorola codes may not work on new Motorola phones. However, we have listed all new and old Motorola Phone (including Motorola Android) secret codes that will work on your Motorola phones.

Google has numerous hidden features inside its Android OS. Besides the venerable Android version-specific Easter eggs, it is also possible to utilize custom dialer codes to access a plethora of apps and settings that are otherwise unreachable for regular users. Some of these codes are universal, which means you'll get the desired output on any device, whether it's a cheap budget phone or one of the best Android phones. Having said that, custom OEM skins (like One UI by Samsung and MIUI by Xiaomi) and carrier-customized models often come with their own set of hidden codes.
 
The so-called hidden codes are basically part of the Man Machine Interface (MMI) schema. These are a bit different from the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) codes, although both of them start with an asterisk (\*) followed by digits that consist of commands or data. Groups of digits may be separated by additional asterisks. The message is terminated with a hash symbol (#), but custom MMI codes may end with an asterisk as well.
 
While USSD codes are used to communicate with the mobile network operator's servers for menu-based information services, mobile-money services, and location-based content services, the MMI Supplementary Service codes work completely offline.
 
The settings menu on Android phones provides ways to manage installed apps, check the battery's health, diagnose network problems, and scan for threats. It also has information such as the device's name, software version, and memory size. You can use secret codes for quick access to these features. Just dial a number on your phone to trigger an action or navigate a hidden diagnostic menu. Some secret codes work on all Android devices, while others are limited to third-party Android skins like One UI for Samsung phones.
 
Android secret short codes are numbers you dial to access hidden menus or actions on your phone. You can dial them to test functions, troubleshoot problems, or check information about your device. These codes are supported by two protocols: the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data protocol (USSD) and the Man Machine Interface (MMI). On the surface, they work the same as they require you to dial codes for secret menu access.
 
USSD and MMI codes have the same structure. They start with an asterisk (\*), end with a hash (#), and use a combination of numbers, asterisks, and hash symbols in between. You'll open the phone dialer app to type and dial them. Most codes automatically run when you enter the last hash (#) symbol. Some require you to tap the call button to execute them.
 
The purpose of both protocols is different. The USSD protocol allows your phone to communicate with your service provider's computers, which process the request and send a response. It supports secret codes that fetch basic services like balance inquiries and prepaid top-ups without an internet connection or going through a long menu. Meanwhile, the MMI protocol supports secret codes that take you to your phone's internal settings and functions. That means the phone processes the code without sending a request to the network provider.
 
Most secret codes run on all Android devices, regardless of the manufacturer. Some work only on manufacturer devices. If a code doesn't work on your phone, its manufacturer doesn't support it. We focus on universal codes that work on most Android phones. They allow you to debug your device without relying on other hacks. Later, we list the exclusive codes for Samsung, Motorola, and OnePlus.
 
The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is a unique 15-digit identifier number assigned to phones running on a GSM network. If your device is lost or stolen, you can use its IMEI number to block it. This way, the thief or person who finds it can't access your contacts, messages, and other personal content.
 
A device's Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value shows you the rate of radio frequency (RF) that your body absorbs from your smartphone. Smartphones mostly emit non-ionizing energy, which is less likely to kill you than radiation from X-rays and similar machines. It lacks the energy needed to break apart the atoms and molecules in your body.
 
Still, you want to be on the safe side. Knowing this information helps you practice habits that reduce your exposure, such as reducing interaction with your device. Dial **#07#** to find your device's SAR value and other regulatory information.
 
If you want to be notified when someone calls you during an ongoing call, activate call waiting services on your phone with the **\*43#**code. You'll hear a unique sound and decide whether to place the current call on hold and answer the incoming one or ignore the incoming call. If you don't want the distraction, turn off the service with the same code.
 
Apps often run in the background, even after you think you've closed them properly. They consume your phone's CPU, RAM, battery, and other resources. Limit them to free up these resources and improve your device's performance. Run **##0283##** to suspend all background processes on your phone. This secret code is more helpful on older Android devices because of their lower-end hardware or outdated software.
 
Call forwarding redirects incoming calls to another phone number or voicemail. When it's active, calls to your phone number automatically go to the number specified. You want to make sure that someone else isn't intercepting your private calls. Dial **\*#67#** to check whether the feature is active on your phone.
 
Here are other secret codes you can run on your Android smartphone to reveal hidden information. We ran these secret codes on Google Pixel and Samsung devices. Some worked and others didn't. Your mileage may vary depending on the smartphone brand you use.
 
Memorizing Android's secret short codes can be challenging, but you don't need all of them. One useful trick is to save them as contacts and name them according to their function. Then, call the codes like a regular number to execute them. It may not work on some devices, but you'll avoid typing long code combinations. Your phone has many mysteries beyond secret codes. Try some of the best Android 14 tips and tricks and boost your phone's performance.
