Since Surah Mulk ( Surah Al Mulk ) has only 56 verses ,we can memorize entire Surah in almost two months by memorizing just one verse per day. This is not a big task but there are countless benefits.

Islamic scholars believe that readers of Surah Waqiah and other surahs will be protected in the both World. To become successful we should read these surahs regularly and understand meanings of these surahs also.
 
**Al-Wāqiʻa**[1] (Arabic: الواقعة; "The Inevitable"[2] or "The Event"[3]) is the 56th surah (chapter) of the Quran. Muslims believe it was revealed in Mecca (see Meccan surah), specifically around 7 years before the Hijrah (622), the migration of Muhammad to Medina.[4] The total number of verses in this surah is 96. It mainly discusses the afterlife according to Islam, and the different fates people will face in it.

The afterlife (*akhirah*) is the main topic discussed in the chapter. Picking up from the preceding chapter, Ar-Rahman, which discusses the rewards of Paradise (*jannah*), this chapter also mentions them and then contrasts them with the punishment of hell. The chapter also distinguishes the three classes of people in the afterlife, "the foremost", "the companions of the right" and "the companions of the left": the first two groups will enter paradise while the companions of the left will go to hell.[3] Here, "the right" is associated with goodness, the righteous will be seated to the right of God's throne and receive their records of deeds in their right hand.[5] The "foremost" refers to a special group of people who will have an even better fate than the companions of the right in the afterlife. Quranic commentators differ on understanding who the foremost is. They variously identify the foremost with the prophets, the saints, the truthful, the martyrs, the first to accept Islam, and others.[6]
 
The traditional Egyptian chronology puts the chapter as the 41st chapter by the order of revelation (after Al-Tur), while the Nldeke Chronology (by the orientalist Theodor Nldeke) puts it as the 46th.[8] The chapter's position in the Quran, which is not determined by the revelation order, is as the 56th chapter, right after Ar-Rahman which discusses partly related topic.
 
In *The Message of The Qur'an*, Muhammad Asad asserts that the "noun hur - rendered as 'companions pure' - is a plural of both ahwar (masculine) and hawra' (female), either of which describes a person distinguished by hawar', which latter term primarily denotes 'intense whiteness of the eyeballs and lustrous black of the iris'. Asad as well as Yusuf Ali and Marmaduke Pickthall translate this verse as:[9][10][11]
 
The *Enlightening Commentary into the Light of the Holy Qur'an* says, "the people of Paradise shall have spouses from amongst houri with fair complexions and wide black eyes who are preserved like pearls in shells".[12][13]
 
The Quran is filled with verses and surahs that bring blessings and barakah into our lives by simply reciting them in our everyday lives. Surah Waqiah, in particular, is said to be a blessing for all Muslims because of its vast **benefits** in your financial life.
 
Commonly termed as the Surah of Wealth, Surah Waqiah brings abundance and prosperity, while protecting you from poverty. Taking a few minutes out of your day to recite this ensures that you reap the unlimited rewards it brings.
 
Surah Waqiah talks about the Companions of the Right, Companions of The Left, and The Forerunners. Each will be rewarded or punished after facing Judgement. The people on the right will be blessed, the people on the left will be miserable, and the forerunners will be foremost in Paradise as the believers closest to Allah.
 
The Surah describes the rewards that the righteous will have in Paradise, such as jewelled thrones, a non-intoxicating pure wine, fruit and other blessings. Whereas the people of the left will be suffering as a result of their actions in this world.
 
Surah Waqiah also reminds belivers of the glory of Allah and how He has given us countless blessings and signs that we can find in nature. It reminds the Muslim Ummah that they are bound to return to him after death
 
The Surah does not take more than 5 minutes to recite, so it is very easy for the average person to fit it into their routine. **Prophet** **Muhammad (PBUH)** advised the Ummah to recite it every night. According to your preference, you can recite it between the prayers of Maghrib and Isha, or after Isha, before you go to bed.
 
Remembrance of Allah on a daily basis brings unlimited blessings, which is why you should recite the **Holy Quran** every day. In particular, Surah Waqiah is more effective in its benefits when it is recited regularly. We have mentioned some of these benefits below:
 
As the Surah talks about the Last Day, you are reminded that there is a Higher Power who is in control of your life. Leaving your worries and stresses to Allah relieves you of the burden of an uncertain life.
 
When you trust Allah with all your financial matters, you feel at peace knowing that your future is safe. Having complete faith that Allah will provide sustenance for you and your family eases you of worries that can harm your physical and mental health.
 
Many hadith have stated Surah Waqiah benefits in protecting you from poverty and giving you financial security. Reciting it every day brings blessings and barakah into your life. It brings success, prosperity, and wealth for you and your family.
 
The prophet himself instructed us to read it daily for its many virtues and lessons and to remind ourselves of the day of judgment. The surah discusses the day of judgment and what will happen to the believers and disbelievers.
 
On the day of judgment, people will be divided into three groups, the Companions of the Right, Companions of The Left, and The Forerunners. Each group will be rewarded or punished based on their deeds and what they did with their lives.
 
The companions of the right are the people who will be rewarded for their good deeds. The companions of the left are the ones who will be punished for their bad deeds. While the forerunners are the ones who will go to paradise first.
 
Reciting surah Waqiah reminds us of the day of judgment, the rewards of the believers. And the punishment that the disbelievers will go through for the bad deeds they did in their lives. It makes us see that life is nothing but a test and that we should pass it to go to the heavens.
 
The surah is known as the surah of wealth and the prophet instructed us to read surah Waqiah every day at night for its many virtues. You could read it at any time but it is better to be at night whether after Maghrib prayer or before going to bed, the call is yours.
 
You can read **surah e waqiah** to get sustenance at the best time as follows. Our Noble Messenger(Allah be pleased with him) mentioned to us when we would read **suratul waqia** as he mentioned it in the hadith:
 
Neither the Sunnah nor any of the books of exegesis or the Quran sciences indicate that there is a particular reason for the entire surah of the waqiah, However, there are reasons for some of surah e waqiah :
 
**Waqiah surah** (Macchi surah) is a Macci surah. It was revealed to our beloved Prophet (P.B.U.H) in Maccah, seven years before He (P.B.U.H) moved. According to certain scholars, it was partially revealed in Madinah and partially in Maccah. The majority, on the other hand, agrees with the disclosure made in Maccah. As a result, it is known as a Macci Surah.
 
It is **surah al waqiah** due to its virtues, that perpetually reading it by thinking and reflecting on its verses, prevents poverty and destitution, brings sustenance, and prevents misery, as it has been called Surat Al-Ghana, and whoever continues to read it is not written by the unaware, because of the intimidation and remembrance of the horrors of the Resurrection, Account, and Punishment, and death, so do not leave the one who reads it an opportunity to be unaware.
 
Talking about the benefits of Waqiah surah and other surahs must not be subject to anything materialistic, and we should not deal with the Quran with logic and a transient worldly goal, just as the more we read, the more Allah grants us or facilitates something in the life of this life.
 
It is beneficial for education, guidance, command, and prohibition that guides us to do good and keeps us away from the forbidden, and the one who has a deep understanding of the Quran, its verses, and miracles, is fully aware of all of this.
 
**Sura waqia** reminds the Muslim of the Day of Judgment and what Allah has prepared for the righteous believers in Paradise, as well as what He has prepared for the unbelievers in the fires of Hell.
 
And you are separated into three groups: the companions of the right, what are the companions of the right? And the companions of the left, what are the companions of the left? And the forerunners are the forerunners
 
All these Blessings await those on the Right Hand who are righteous, good-doing believers. They are known as the people on the Right Hand because the records of their deeds will be given to their right hands and they will be known as the fortunate and happy.
 
Surah Al-Waqiah is all about wealth and success. It teaches us that everything in this life is temporary and that the only thing that truly matters is our relationship with Allah. The surah begins with a reminder of the Judgment Day to all believers. It then goes on to describe the people who will be successful on that day. These are the people who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and who have done good deeds.
 
Reciting al-Waqiaah before bed, will certainly allow believers to experience
