According to the Puranas, Kurukshetra is a region named after King Kuru, the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas. This is place where Mahabharata war was fought. Also the Bhagavad Gita was explained there during the war when Lord Krishna found Arjuna in a difficult situation.[1]
 
Before 1947, Thanesar was the name of the tehsil headquarters and the town. Thanesar or Sthaneswar is a historical town next to newly created Kurukshetra city. Thanesar derives its name from the word "Sthaneshwar", which means "Place of God".

In most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not a city but a region ("kshetra" meaning "region" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra lies to the central and western parts of state of Haryana and southern Punjab. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin.[2]
 
By the archaeological grounds it has been proved that Ashoka the Great made Kurukshetra a centre of learning for people from all over the world. It reached the peak of its progress during the reign of King Harsha, during which Chinese scholar Xuanzang visited Thanesar.
 
Kurukshetra has great importance as a Hindu pilgrimage. There are several pilgrimages around the city of kurukshetra and a complete parikrama means to visit all these pilgrimages. 48 kos parikrama is a Hindi phrase meaning 48 miles circle around the holy city of Kurukshetra.[7]
 
L'endroit est clbre pour avoir t le champ de la bataille de Kurukshetra, un combat pique dont parle le rcit sacr de l'hindouisme: le Mahabharata et plus spcifiquement la Bhagavad-Gita. Il dcrit le combat entre les Kauravas et les Pandavas, avec comme protagonistes principaux le hros Arjuna et son conducteur de char, Krishna[2].
 
D'un point de vue philosophique, dans le rcit de la Bhagavad-Gita, il reprsente le lieu du combat ( la fois intrieur et extrieur) du hros Arjuna, tiraill entre ses ombres temporelles (reprsentes par la famille des Kauravas) et sa partie lumineuse atemporelle (reprsente par les Pandavas, dont il est le Prince). Le kurukshetra devient ainsi une image des obstacles et des choix que chaque homme doit affronter pour accomplir son devoir (le svadharma, dans la philosophie hindoue).
