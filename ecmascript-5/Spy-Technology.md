**Technology** is the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a reproducible way.[1] The word *technology* can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,[2][3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.
 
Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.

While technology contributes to economic development and improves human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution and resource depletion, and can cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, and ways to mitigate its downsides are ongoing.
 
Starting in the 19th century, continental Europeans started using the terms *Technik* (German) or *technique* (French) to refer to a 'way of doing', which included all technical arts, such as dancing, navigation, or printing, whether or not they required tools or instruments.[7] At the time, *Technologie* (German and French) referred either to the academic discipline studying the "methods of arts and crafts", or to the political discipline "intended to legislate on the functions of the arts and crafts."[8] Since the distinction between *Technik* and *Technologie* is absent in English, both were translated as *technology*. The term was previously uncommon in English and mostly referred to the academic discipline, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[9]
 
In the 20th century, as a result of scientific progress and the Second Industrial Revolution, *technology* stopped being considered a distinct academic discipline and took on its current-day meaning: the systemic use of knowledge to practical ends.[10]
 
Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error.[11] Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp hand axe.[12] This practice was refined 75 kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work.[13]
 
The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as "possibly the greatest ever made by man".[14] Archaeological, dietary, and social evidence point to "continuous [human] fire-use" at least 1.5 Mya.[15] Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.[16] The *cooking hypothesis* proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size, though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive.[17] Archaeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya; researchers believe this is likely to have intensified human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language.[18][19]
 
Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter.[20] No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology, but archaeologists have found archaeological evidence of clothing 90-120 kya[21] and shelter 450 kya.[20] As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 kya, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.[22][23] Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya, initially moving to Eurasia.[24][25][26]
 
The Neolithic Revolution (or *First Agricultural Revolution*) brought about an acceleration of technological innovation, and a consequent increase in social complexity.[27] The invention of the polished stone axe was a major advance that allowed large-scale forest clearance and farming.[28] This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic but was originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland.[29] Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed for the simultaneous raising of more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried around by nomads. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could participate in hunter-gatherer activities.[30][31]

With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization.[32] What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as Uruk, and the first civilizations, such as Sumer, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation, are all thought to have played a role.[33]
 
After harnessing fire, humans discovered other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to around 7,000 BCE.[39] From prehistoric times, Egyptians likely used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins.[40] The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation.[41]
 
Archaeologists estimate that the wheel was invented independently and concurrently in Mesopotamia (in present-day Iraq), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture), and Central Europe.[42] Time estimates range from 5,500 to 3,000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4,000 BCE.[43] The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about 3,500 BCE.[44] More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana Marsh of Slovenia.[45]
 
The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used a potter's wheel and may have invented it.[46] A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3,429 BCE,[47] and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area.[47] Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois[48] and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around 3,000 BCE.[48]
 
Ancient Minoan private homes had running water.[51] A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos.[51][52] Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain.[51] The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets,[52] which emptied into an extensive sewage system.[52] The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima;[52] construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today.[52]
 
The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts,[50] which were used to transport water across long distances.[50] The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE.[50] The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE.[50] Put together, the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 km,[50] but less than 70 km of this was above ground and supported by arches.[50]
 
Innovations continued through the Middle Ages with the introduction of silk production (in Asia and later Europe), the horse collar, and horseshoes. Simple machines (such as the lever, the screw, and the pulley) were combined into more complicated tools, such as the wheelbarrow, windmills, and clocks.[53] A system of universities developed and spread scientific ideas and practices, including Oxford and Cambridge.[54]
 
The Renaissance era produced many innovations, including the introduction of the movable type printing press to Europe, which facilitated the communication of knowledge. Technology became increasingly influenced by science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement.[55]
 
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the discovery of steam power set off the Industrial Revolution, which saw wide-ranging technological discoveries, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, and the widespread application of the factory system.[56] This was followed a century later by the Second Industrial Revolution which led to rapid scientific discovery, standardization, and mass production. New technologies were developed, including sewage systems, electricity, light bulbs, electric motors, railroads, automobiles, and airplanes. These technological advances led to significant developments in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering.[57] They were accompanied by consequential social change, with the introduction of skyscrapers accompanied by rapid urbanization.[58] Communication improved with the invention of the telegraph, the telephone, the radio, and television.[59]
