This document provides a summary of the requirements for a hotel management system being developed for Hotel Dayal. It outlines the purpose, scope, and objectives of the system, which is to automate major hotel operations like reservations, room management, inventory control, and guest management. The system will have three types of end users (owner, manager, receptionist) with different access levels. The document provides an overview of the system's product perspective and functions. Tables of contents and references are also included.Read less
 
Clearly defined requirements are essential signs on the road to a successful project. They establish a formal agreement between clients and providers that they are both working to reach the same goal. High-quality, detailed requirements also help mitigate financial risks and keep the project on schedule. According to the definition found in the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK), requirements are a usable representation of a need.

These include high-level statements of goals, objectives, and needs. Business requirements do not have any details or specific features. They just state the problem and the business objective to be achieved, such as
 
This group of requirements reflects the needs of discrete stakeholder groups (top-level managers, nonmanagement staff, customers, etc.) and defines what they expect from a particular solution. They serve as a bridge between generalized business requirements and specific solution requirements. They are outlined in a User Requirements Specification and can include, for example, the ability to create various reports, view order history and status, manage customer databases, etc.
 
Functional and nonfunctional requirements are two fundamental categories of requirements in software development. Each type plays a vital role in defining the characteristics and operation of the solution.
 
**Authentication**. This group is about verifying the identity of a user before allowing access to the system, including entering usernames and passwords, biometric verification, or multifactor authentication.
 
**Authorization levels**. These requirements aim to define and control the access levels of different users within a system. For example, an admin may have complete system access, while a regular user has limited access to certain features.
 
**Transaction handling**. This group contains requirements for handling transactions. They are especially important in systems that deal with financial processes or require record-keeping of transactions.

**Error handling and logging**. These requirements specify how the system should handle errors and log them, e.g., defining error messages, troubleshooting steps, and maintaining logs for system activities.
 
Reliability defines how likely it is for the software to work without failure for a given time. Reliability decreases because of bugs in the code, hardware failures, or problems with other system components.

**Example**: The database update process must roll back all related updates when any update fails.
 
Scalability requirements describe how the system must grow without negatively impacting its performance. It means serving more users, processing more data, and doing more transactions. Scalability has both hardware and software implications. For instance, you can increase scalability by adding memory, servers, or disk space. On the other hand, you can compress data, use optimizing algorithms, etc.

**Example**: The website attendance limit must be scalable enough to support 200,000 users at a time.
 
**Requirements management** is about ensuring that all requirements are met during the development process and that any changes are carefully controlled and documented. The key components of requirements management are
 
Requirements are usually written in text, especially for Agile-driven projects. However, they may also be visuals. The most common document to describe the system and list the requirements is the SRS.
 
We can formalize functional and nonfunctional requirements in the software requirements specification (SRS) document. The SRS contains descriptions of functions and capabilities that the product must provide. It also defines constraints and assumptions.
 
A Work Breakdown Structure, or WBS, is a document that illustrates how complex processes break down into their simpler components. A WBS is an effective approach to allow for an independent analysis of each part. It also helps capture the full picture of the project.

We suggest the following logic of functional decomposition:
 
Since we have to make functional and nonfunctional requirements understandable for all stakeholders, we must capture them in an easy-to-read format. The two most typical formats are use cases and user stories.
 
Use cases describe the interaction between the system and external users that leads to achieving particular goals.

Each use case includes three main elements:

**Actors**. These are the external users that interact with the system.

**System**. The system is described by functional requirements that define the intended behavior of the product.

**Goals**. The purposes of the interaction between the users and the system are outlined as goals.

There are two ways to represent use cases: a use case specification and a use case diagram.
 
A **use case specification** represents the sequence of events and other information related to this use case. A typical use case specification template includes the following information:
 
A user story is a documented description of a software functionality seen from the end-user perspective. The user story describes what exactly the user wants the system to do. In Agile projects, user stories are organized in a backlog. Currently, user stories are considered the best format for backlog items.

A typical user story looks like this:

As a , I want so that .

Example:

As an admin, I want to add product descriptions so that users can later view these descriptions and compare the products.

User stories must be accompanied by acceptance criteria. These are the conditions the product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, stakeholders, or a product owner.
 
For you as a hotelier, hotel management software is one of your most important assets. Choosing the one PMS system that will best fit your hospitality business means to make a good research on the latest hotel PMS solutions and what's trending in property management systems in general. Doing this while managing all your other duties might be tough. Relax, you don't have to be an IT expert, neither to hire one. You just need to ask the right questions - first to yourself and then to your prospective hotel software provider.
 
A hotel management system is not worth the investment if it is not capable of increasing your revenue and improving the quality of your working life. You will need to ask yourself a few questions before you start your evaluation process.
 
You sure can add your own questions to the list and this was the genuine idea behind it. The trick is not to ask open questions and get some vague responses. The trick is to stick strictly to your **specific challenges** and to ask **specific questions** about the instruments you will get to deal with them.
 
Once you limit the number of potential PMS vendors and create your Top 5 or Top 10 hotel software systems list, other questions will certainly arise. Ask again, and again, until you find it - your perfect hotel management software that will serve your successful hospitality business and help you improve your bottom line, your service and your working life all alike.
 
**One last tip:** Only go for a software solution that is offered with a free trial, live demo, or both. Live demonstration is when someone from the software development company joins you, on-site or in an online session, and demonstrates the hotel PMS features you need. Hotel management systems, like any other enterprise or maintenance software, combine multiple functionalities and sometimes it's hard to get the full picture at first glance. Getting a live demo before starting your own trial is a good way to get a common idea of how the system works and if it does match your needs and requirements. So ask, always ask, ask everything. Good software providers shouldn't fear your questions.
