It is difficult to describe the feelings I feel every time I play this music. It truly sings to my soul and has me in tears. Thank you so much for your generosity in sharing your beautiful music. You are so gifted in word and music and are blessing many lives.
 
Thank you for this beautiful song. My friend and I have performed this twice before for a Temple Devotional and a fireside and were just asked to sing it for Easter Sunday. The first time I heard it I fell in love with it and have felt the Spirit each time I have sung it.

Just want to send a heartfelt note of gratitude to you for sharing your beautiful gift to bless us all! I have loved and used your arrangements for many years, now, and everyone of them fills my soul!
 
Because He Lives does not print correctly. Page 1 of the duet prints Holding Hands Around the World and Because He Lives on top of each other. The SATB prints only page 1 correctly and the other pages are printed with Holding Hands Around the World and Because He Lives on top of each other.
 
To cite from another post, the duet piece had three different versions of this song based on high, medium and low voices. Currently I can only see the High (E-flat Maj) voices duet on the page. Is there anyway that you can post the other two? (Only one that I know of is the D-Maj key).

In the box where you can download the songs it says to just click on the download button to do so. but there is no download button for any of this songs versions. I desperately want this song to listen to during this hard time in my life right now and want to sing it with the accompaniment for my fiance too. How can I download (the duet James Loynes and Allyse Smith Taylor version, and the accompaniment version)? It says that it is free.
 
Our Key Center (Gig Harbor Stake, Washington) Ensemble uses your wonderful arrangements with great results. We also enjoy having both piano and organ on the accompaniments or as stand alone duets. How we would love to see more piano/organ duets. Anything in the works in that regard?
 
Hi Sally DeFord, Thank you very much for sharing us your music. I really love your compositions they are indeed faith promoting and helps us increase our love of the Savior. May God bless you always and continue to give you strength to inspire more people with your music.
 
These years I get to sing, which, if I have a talent in music, is mine, not directing, as I have done in musically challenged wards. Fortunately there are many in my ward with real talent and training to lead. Still, I count it a personal blessing when they turn to your site as I so often did.
 
Thank you so much, Sally DeFord, for your generosity in sharing your beautiful compositions with churches free of charge. I am the choir director for a small parish, and we do not have a budget for acquiring new music. Thank you for helping to keep my personal costs down, and for providing our choir with deeply inspiring pieces. We plan to sing Because He Lives the third Sunday of Easter this year. It brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.

Hi: I am a Chinese American Christian with CCIC (Chinese Christian In Christ) in Cupertino, CA. I came across this hymn some time ago, touched and loved it so much that I wish to try to provide a Chinese translation version for our church choir to sing during worship (non-commercial use). May I win your favor of approval? I hope there is no copy right issue. I also have put these into music sheet form (just like the Finnish and Spanish translation verisons). If you deem necessary, I can e mail to you for your review as well. Please let me know your response at your convenience.
