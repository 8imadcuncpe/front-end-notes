The term *gigabyte* has a standard definition of 10003 bytes, as well as a discouraged[2] meaning of 10243 bytes. The latter binary usage originated as compromise technical jargon for byte multiples that needed to be expressed in a power of 2, but lacked a convenient name. As 1024 (210) is approximately 1000 (103), roughly corresponding to SI multiples, it was used for binary multiples as well.
 
In 1998 the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published standards for binary prefixes, requiring that the gigabyte strictly denote 10003 bytes and gibibyte denote 10243 bytes. By the end of 2007, the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE, EU, and NIST, and in 2009 it was incorporated in the International System of Quantities. Nevertheless, the term gigabyte continues to be widely used with the following two different meanings:
 
Based on powers of 10, this definition uses the prefix giga- as defined in the International System of Units (SI). This is the recommended definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).[4] This definition is used in networking contexts and most storage media, particularly hard drives, flash-based storage,[5][6] and DVDs, and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing, such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance. The file manager of Mac OS X version 10.6 and later versions are a notable example of this usage in software, which report files sizes in decimal units.[7]
 
The binary definition uses powers of the base 2, as does the architectural principle of binary computers.This usage is widely promulgated by some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory (e.g., RAM). This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous unit gibibyte.
 
Since the first disk drive, the IBM 350, disk drive manufacturers expressed hard drive capacities using decimal prefixes. With the advent of gigabyte-range drive capacities, manufacturers labelled many consumer hard drive, solid-state drive and USB flash drive capacities in certain size classes expressed in decimal gigabytes, such as "500 GB". The exact capacity of a given drive model is usually slightly larger than the class designation. Practically all manufacturers of hard disk drives and flash-memory disk devices[5][6] continue to define one gigabyte as 1000000000bytes, which is displayed on the packaging. Some operating systems such as Mac OS X[8] and Ubuntu,[9] and Debian[10] express hard drive capacity or file size using decimal multipliers, while others such as Microsoft Windows report size using binary multipliers. This discrepancy causes confusion, as a disk with an advertised capacity of, for example, 400 GB (meaning 400000000000bytes, equal to 372 GiB) might be reported by the operating system as "372 GB".

A lawsuit decided in 2019 that arose from alleged breach of contract and other claims over the binary and decimal definitions used for "gigabyte" have ended in favour of the manufacturers, with courts holding that the legal definition of gigabyte or GB is 1 GB = 1,000,000,000 (109) bytes (the decimal definition). Specifically, the courts held that "the U.S. Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the 'preferred' one for the purposes of 'U.S. trade and commerce' .... The California Legislature has likewise adopted the decimal system for all 'transactions in this state'."[2]
 
Earlier lawsuits had ended in settlement with no court ruling on the question, such as a lawsuit against drive manufacturer Western Digital.[12][13] Western Digital settled the challenge and added explicit disclaimers to products that the usable capacity may differ from the advertised capacity.[12]Seagate was sued on similar grounds and also settled.[12][14]
 
Because of their physical design, the capacity of modern computer random-access memory devices, such as DIMM modules, is always a multiple of a power of 1024. It is thus convenient to use prefixes denoting powers of 1024, known as binary prefixes, in describing them. For example, a memory capacity of 1073741824bytes (10243 B) is conveniently expressed as 1 GiB rather than as 1.074 GB. The former specification is, however, often quoted as "1 GB" when applied to random-access memory.[15]
 
Software allocates memory in varying degrees of granularity as needed to fulfill data structure requirements and binary multiples are usually not required. Other computer capacities and rates, like storage hardware size, data transfer rates, clock speeds, operations per second, etc., do not depend on an inherent base, and are usually presented in decimal units. For example, the manufacturer of a "300 GB" hard drive is claiming a capacity of 300000000000bytes, not 300 10243 (which would be 322122547200) bytes.

A gigabyte (GB) -- pronounced with two hard Gs -- is a unit of data storage capacity that is roughly equivalent to 1 billion bytes. In decimal notation (base 10), a gigabyte is exactly 1 billion bytes. In binary notation (base 2), a gigabyte is equal to 230 bytes, or 1,073,741,824 bytes. Giga comes from a Greek word meaning giant. Werner Buchholz is credited with coining the term byte in 1956, while helping design IBM's 7030 Stretch, the first transistorized supercomputer.
 
A gigabyte has been a common unit of capacity measurement for data storage products since the mid-1980s. In recent years, terabytes (TB) have become a more common unit of storage capacity measurement, especially for hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
 
Cloud providers and hardware vendors still often refer to storage capacity costs in terms of the amount per gigabyte, although that's been slowly transitioning to costs per terabyte. Today's HDDs and flash SSDs can easily store hundreds of gigabytes of data or even thousands, which is why the TB label has been steadily replacing GB in many instances.
 
For example, an HDD might offer 500 GB of raw capacity but is currently storing only 200 GB of data. In addition to stored data, the gigabyte might also be used to refer to the amount of transferred data or storage throughput.
 
The difference between the decimal amount and the binary amount has caused a fair amount of confusion among consumers, especially if they also come across such terms as kibibyte, mebibyte, gibibyte or tebibyte.
 
Computer, storage and network systems use two standards to measure the number of bytes in a gigabyte: base 10 and base 2. The base 10 definition of gigabyte uses the decimal system to show that 1 GB is equal to 109 bytes, or 1 billion bytes. Today, most storage manufacturers and consumers use the base 10 standard to define a gigabyte.
 
Computers and their operating systems often use the base 2, or binary, form of measurement, in which 1 GB equals 1,073,741,824 bytes. In this model, a gigabyte is sometimes referred to as a gibibyte, although not all vendors take this approach, thus the confusion. In the early days of storage, this wasn't a significant issue because the discrepancy between the base 10 and base 2 measurements wasn't substantial. However, the differences became more pronounced as vendors started manufacturing storage media with more capacity.
 
Because of the differences between the two standards, users might see discrepancies on their systems in how the amount of storage is reported. For example, a manufacturer might show the
