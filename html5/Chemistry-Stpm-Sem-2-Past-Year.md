The search for new drugs to tackle cancer, heart disease and infections remains an important challenge at the forefront of medical research. Advances in global healthcare rely on highly skilled graduates with research skills and a strong background in organic chemistry, coupled with a broad understanding of pharmacology and related biochemical areas.
 
The MChem in Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry makes ideal preparation for students keen to contribute to the drug discovery and development of the future or who have an interest in industrial or academic research.

MChem Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry provides you with the opportunity to study chemistry as a major subject along with subjects allied to the medical and pharmaceutical industries. For instance, in year one you will develop a sound understanding of the core chemistry principles, while in year two you will deepen your knowledge of the principles of biological chemistry with an emphasis on topics which are relevant to the medical and pharmaceutical industry. The biological modules do not depend on having a background in biology.
 
In year three further advanced topics relevant to medicinal and biological chemistry are studied and two investigative projects are undertaken. You will also carry out an in-depth literature review of a key topic, leading to specialised knowledge in a particular field.
 
Across the duration of your undergraduate studies you will gain practical hands-on laboratory experience in our state-of-the-art STEMLab facilities. You have the opportunity to add further value to your time at Loughborough by spending a placement year in industry gaining highly sought-after workplace experience or by exploring options for study abroad. As a student of chemistry at Loughborough you will benefit from high levels of pastoral support, a peer-mentoring scheme, and the compelling insights of our renowned academic staff, many of whom are active in research with far-reaching impact.
 
Both the Chemistry BSc (Hons) degree and the Chemistry MChem (Hons) degree are orientated towards the practice of chemistry in the world outside the University. Our 3 (or 4 year sandwich) BSc equips you for employment in chemistry, scientific and other sectors. The 4 (or 5 year sandwich) MChem is suited for students who may wish to pursue a PhD or a career in industrial research.
 
If you choose to study our Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry degree you will experience the facilities housed in our recently opened STEMLab, as well enjoying access to additional refurbished lab space in our Sir David Davies building. Plus, as a Loughborough University student you benefit from our peer mentoring scheme, supporting your transition into university life.
 
Lecturers from industry contribute to the teaching of our undergraduate courses and sponsor research projects, while the option of a placement year can provide a real boost to your employability. At Loughborough you'll be getting "hands on" in the lab while also growing the transferable skills looked for by employers.
 
Throughout your course you will be taught by academic staff who are engaged in wide-ranging research with real-world impact in such areas as health and medicine, crime and security, sustainability, and clean energy. Studying chemistry at Loughborough, you will become part of a friendly, supportive, and international community of scientists devoted to tackling today's global challenges.

Enable students to develop essential laboratory skills that are required in inorganic, organic, analytical and physical chemistry, and introduce students to fundamental software packages required for chemical report writing and data manipulation.
 
A part aim for this module is to enable students to become aware of and develop their academic, professional and personal skills through Personal Best. Personal Best is a development programme available to all students at Loughborough University.
 
The aim of this module is to introduce concepts in thermodynamics, redox and phase equilibria, and to introduce their applications to the understanding of chemical and physical change, and in chemical analysis.
 
The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the theory and applications of analytical separation and structural elucidation techniques, and to develop their analytical data manipulation skills.
 
The aim of this module is to introduce the major types of chemical reactions in organic and inorganic chemistry, and the relationships between chemical structure, reactivity and behaviour of organic and inorganic compounds.
 
The aims of this module are to introduce the functions of the major organs of the body, cell structure and biochemical pathways, the chemical basis of metabolism, and the design of drugs and their associated actions.
 
The aims of this module are to develop research skills through critical assessment of scientific literature and introduction to methods and procedures for undertaking investigative research work in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry.
 
The aim of this module is for the student to understand the principles behind how drugs are rationally designed and screened, and how drug compounds are absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted (ADME) within the body. This includes analogue synthesis and use of natural compounds as drug candidates.
 
The aims of this module are to introduce the student to advanced concepts in physical chemistry, and their application in electrochemistry, photochemistry, computational methods and the properties of materials.
 
The aim of this module is to provide advanced training in modern analytical chemistry as applied to biological systems, including mass spectrometry and related techniques, biospecific techniques, elemental analysis and sample preparation, highlighting applications in health monitoring, clinical and forensic areas, illustrated with examples of current research.
 
The aim of this module is to enable students to understand medicinal chemistry, how drugs act at a molecular level and are designed and synthesised, and how these activities may be assessed in a drug development programme.
 
MChem students must obtain an average of 55% or above in Years 2 and 3 to progress to the next year of the course. Your MChem degree classification will be determined by the weighted average of your marks obtained in years 2, 3 and 4 in the ratio 20:40:40.
 
Your placement is spent at one or more organisations over 45 weeks, enabling you to get firsthand experience of a real role with real responsibilities. You will you be able to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired in a workplace setting while developing the competencies that are highly prized by graduate recruiters. A year in industry also gives you the opportunity to grow your network of contacts, attend training courses, impress an employer and in some instances secure a graduate job. If you are still unsure what you want to do when you leave university, a placement enables you to "test-drive" a career and find out if a professional area is right for you.
 
At Loughborough we have robust, long-standing links with the chemical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries. Our students have been able to spend a year working with major companies such as AstraZeneca, BioFocus, GlaxoSmithKline, 3M Healthcare, Lubrizol, RB (Reckitt-Benckiser), Nemaura Pharma, Pirelli Tyres, GE Healthcare, and the Home Office.
 
Loughborough University actively encourages students to gain an international experience. Students can do this through a study exchange or through a work placement outside of the UK. In both cases the opportunity to gain insight into another culture, broaden experience and develop both intellectual and personal maturity, is invaluable.
 
The synthetic chemistry teaching laboratory, located within the STEMLab building, has 36 fume hoods available for undergraduate teaching. You are able to use a wide variety of equipment including stirrer hotplates and the use of a laboratory microwave reactor, then use rotary evaporators to remove the solvent. Characterisation of the material is carried out in a separate suite, attached to the main lab. There is a selection of instrumentation available including 2 benchtop NMR spectrometers capable of processing proton, carbon and fluorine nuclei experiments, 4 InfraRed spectrometers and 4 UV/vis spectrophotometers, as well as 2 magnetic susceptibility balances, an HPLC instrument and several conductivity probes. The lab is run by a technical team who specialise in synthetic chemistry and support the students with their practical work throughout their time in the laboratories.
