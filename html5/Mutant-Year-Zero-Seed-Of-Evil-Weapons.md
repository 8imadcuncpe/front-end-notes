**Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden** was one of the biggest surprises to me last year. The game adapted a tabletop RPG with tired post-apocalyptic setting by populating itself with strange animal-human hybrids that were interesting both in design and attitude. Developers Bearded Ladies Consulting also added elements to the turn-based strategy genre, one of my favorite genres, that I had never seen before. While the fun characters were never really given a plot worthy of their charms, it ended up being a flawed, but incredibly smart evolution of the genre.

To go along with the new areas, you have an entirely new mutant added to your party early on. Big Khan is a giant, fire-breathing moose that packs just as much personality as the other characters. I kept him in my three-person party throughout the entire DLC, not just because he was new, but because he managed to be useful. His default pool of health is higher than most of the other characters, making him a valuable asset in some of the longer duration fights. Healing items are a luxury in the world of Mutant Year Zero, so every extra hit points counts.
 
Despite these changes, combat is largely unchanged from the base game. Because this is end game content, the enemies are higher level, making it harder to be able to deal enough damage with your silenced, weaker weapons to isolate and covertly eliminate stragglers. Being able to manage the battlefield with stealthy ambushes was one of my favorite elements, so taking that away reduced my enjoyment a bit while also making battles feel a bit more overwhelming and harder to manage.
 
Several things that frustrated me in the base game are not addressed in Seed of Evil. I still question the inclusion of permadeath in a game where you have such a small in-mission squad and such a small pool of characters to choose from. Since you still only heal to half health after a battle on the default difficulty setting, I feel like they could have added more abilities to give players options to heal their units without using precious health packs. I understand the game is meant to be challenging, but it caused me to frequently save and load in order to get through battles without losing characters.
 
And in this wider context, part of me wonders if the focus on transmission is part of the problem. Everyone from statisticians to Brexiteers knows that they are right. The only remaining problem is how to convince others. Go on Facebook and you will find a million people with a million different opinions, each confident in her own judgment, each zealously devoted to informing everyone else.
 
1. Debate where two people with opposing views are *talking* to each other (or writing, or IMing, or some form of bilateral communication). Not a pundit putting an article on *Huffington Post* and demanding Trump supporters read it. Not even a Trump supporter who comments on the article with a counterargument that the author will never read. Two people who have chosen to engage and to listen to one another.

A while ago I blogged about a journalistic spat between German Lopez and Robert VerBruggen on gun control. Lopez wrote a voxsplainer citing some statistics about guns. VerBruggen wrote a piece at National Review saying that some of the statistics were flawed. German fired back (pun not intended) with an article claiming that VerBruggen was ignoring better studies.
 
All of this is too slow and uncertain for a world that needs more wisdom *now*. It would be nice to force the matter, to pelt people with speeches and documentaries until they come around. This will work in the short term. In the long term, it will leave you back where you started.
 
If you want people to be right more often than chance, you have to teach them ways to distinguish truth from falsehood. If this is in the face of enemy action, you will have to teach them so well that they cannot be fooled. You will have to do it person by person until the signal is strong and clear. You will have to raise the sanity waterline. There is no shortcut.
 
You know how the press is trying to figure out how to best hold Trump accountable, and the answer is to have spent the last 8 years holding Obama accountable? Same issue here. The way to undermine white power is to have not fanned the flames of ethno-power for the past X decades.
 
I really have trouble seeing how attacking the NAACP right now accomplishes anything. If anything your plan would probably just result in the anti-racists becoming divided amongst themselves, creating a lot more sound and noise without adding any more reason, and making the white nationalists more effective.
 
But the NAACP is not a black nationalist organization. If you can find comparable groups to white nationalists among these other races (I dunno, the Nation of Islam, maybe?), then by all means condemn them.
 
Or are you pointing out that from the perspective of other cultures being appropriated, assimilated, and merged into an evolving American culture could also be considered an example of the same sort of cosmopolitan philosophy?
 
I bit more idle googling shows that this is more controversial than I thought, with several studies showing that intra-generational (i.e., measuring start to end for individuals, not similar points between parents and children) mobility is fairly stable.
 
And the big difference between then and now: used to be when you showed up off the boat you got the Irish or the Pollack beaten out of you until you started acting American. You were not welcomed with open arms to take part in our multicultural parade while any American who suggested maybe some of your old world traditions need updating for 21st century America got shouted down as a vile racist.
 
So, naturally, the most productive locations are going to be the ones where people mostly \*do\* agree. You want to find a crowd where you can respect them as individuals, and acknowledge their intellectual contributions.
 
Which is one reason this is a very nice post but ultimately gives me no hope. Not all the other weapons out there are symmetric either. If position A is outside the Overton window and position !A is inside it, this completely overwhelms any advantage position A may have by having support from objective reality.

Consider the issue of homosexuality. A century or so back, arguing that there was nothing wrong with it and homosexuals should be treated just like everyone else was outside the Overton window for the U.S. and U.K. Now, the opposite argument is outside.
 
I mean, I and several other posters here are on the record as being implacably opposed to SJ and all its works, will argue against it in all cases and against all comers, and in doing so have driven most of the pro-SJ people out through sheer frustration. SJ usually cannot be mentioned without spawning a lengthy thread of people contributing their own opinions on exactly why SJ is uniquely the worst. What would more opposed to SJ look like? Heads on sticks?
 
For example, many people equivocate feminism with egalitarianism and treat rejection of the former as rejection of the latter (and acceptance of the latter as necessitating acceptance of the former). Yet, feminists tend to demand a specific and highly debatable interpretation of egalitarianism of people who call themselves a feminist.
 
The sloppy mental models that many people have around this issue obscures that the SJ vocabulary is not neutral; that certain premises are articles of faith, rather than fact; that a common method is to stereotype individuals based on their identity, which has major issues; etc.
 
There are plenty of ideologies where the terminal values and the tactics/the culture diverge, plenty of ideologies that say they are doing good but because of some flaw do less good than they could and perhaps do harm, etc. SJ cannot, realistically, be held to be more than a very minor example of any of this.
 
If you were trying to make an ideology look good, you could worse than banning all the worst representatives of that ideology and leaving its more effective advocates untouched. (Not, to be clear, that I think Scott is doing that either. All this conspiracy nonsense is ridiculous.)
 
Indeed it has. I expect the whining about it to last until the heat death of the universe. In fact, there are some posters that complain so bitterly about virtually everything Scott posts or does that one wonders why they even stick around.

So from my experience, this conversation exists, but is damned hard to find even with longtime friends. I certainly don't think it helped that a lot of the rhetoric in play this election was "if you treat your opponents as better than subhuman, it means you're complicit in their evil". The conversations I had were all depressingly furtive, as though non-hostile political discussion was treason.
 
(in particular, breaking up with someone is a personal decision, and made by aggregate judgement /projection of your expected future together. -which is mostly a mixture of intuitition and values/preference. Public policy debate is the exact opposite, bias is something to be minimised rather than arguably a bonus. As such rational debate is less applicable to such personal values decisions, but is the core of what all
