The 8,000-member church in Redding was accused of working with a Melbourne, Australia-based group known as Christalignment, which claims to have worked with many churches in that country to do such readings, but Bethel responded by saying that Christalignment is not formally affiliated with Bethel and nor does it use "Christian tarot cards."
 
Bethel admitted the leaders of Christalignment, Ken and Jenny Hodge, are connected with several of their church members as the Hodges are the parents to church evangelist Ben Fitzgerald, and said the church leaders "have a value for what they are seeking to accomplish."

"We practice a form of supernatural healing that flows from the universal presence of the Christ. We draw from the same divine energy of the Christ spirit, as ancient followers did and operate only out of the third heaven realm to gain insight and revelation," they say.
 
Bethel said it reached out to the Hodges to respond to critics. "The Hodge's ministry is a form of outreach meant to share Jesus with those who have never met Him, or think they hate Him, or worse, that God hates them," the statement reads. "This practice is not what the Hodges do in church, in their devotional lives and Bible study, when making major life decisions, or when discipling people. It is not taught as the next great way of maturity, a secret new thing for young Christians, or an easy syncretism. This ministry is a way of getting people to stop and engage with fellow humans so that they might encounter the love of the Father and the truth of His Son Jesus Christ."
 
The cards Christalignment uses are "not tarot nor remotely similar to tarot," she wrote. "We know tarot cards are very dangerous and highly discourage it. The tools we made help us lead people into deep God-encounters at our tables, and our aim at Christalignment is to attract tarot reading clients, people who are fully into new age practices, psychics, and witches. All of these people can immediately recognize that our cards are not tarot once they sit down at our tables."
 
She added, "Card sets, including cards we made named "Psalm cards" with scriptures on them, address the gifting in a person's life. The color God is showing the person in a prayer encounter will speak to the person through the prophetic image on the front or meaning on the back. It's the same as when we give someone a prophetic painting, just much smaller. They are all non-predictive, but we call them destiny cards as we believe that giftings and callings given by God for people are certainly part of their destiny."

I was an early adopter of a bad attitude toward Chief. As soon as they announced they're "a network of 2000 female executives on their way up," I thought: 2000? There are not that many women in all of corporate America who want to climb the ranks to be CEO.
 
This year Chief raised $100 million from investors "to help female executives connect with their peers." What? Why would women who are already successful want VCs to build them a network of successful women? VCs can't even build themselves a network of successful women.

My economist crush, Claudia Goldin, just published her book Career and Family that is the pinnacle of her career as a data ninja of gender equity. Everything I've ever written here about women and work is in her book.
 
Goldin says that after women feel power over their own destiny, they want a more traditional, gendered role in life. A great example of this is the Barbie movie. We can love that movie now because in our world if Ken treats Barbie badly and they get divorced, Barbie gets to keep half the money.
 
Barbie has held dozens of jobs including doctor, astronaut, engineer and CEO. Today her outrageous resume reads a lot like her outrageous body: Camp. Fun. From another time. Goldin shows that the better educated you are, the richer you are, the more likely you are to quit working. These trends make it difficult for companies to meet their targets for hiring high-level women. So female executives are in huge demand and need no extra help from Chief.
 
Did you see the documentary about the LuLaRoe pyramid scheme? The reason so many women overlooked red flags about LuLaRoe is the women wanted so much to stay home with kids but they felt pressure to earn money. The LuLaRoe movie is the flip side of the Barbie movie. Both speak to the trend of women choosing more gendered roles for themselves.
 
If LuLaRoe is the pyramid for women who quit their jobs, Chief is the pyramid for women before they quit. The only actual executive-level women with Chief are investors in Chief and recruiters (who probably wonder Where all the good candidates?) After that Chief hit a wall, because most female executives turn down money and promotions to be with their kids.
 
The big rule of corporate life is LINE MANAGEMENT. That is, if you want to get to move up you have to be responsible for revenue rather than being part of a cost center. Chief started specializing in attracting women in cost centers, and then focused on female-dominated industries like education, and Chief offered affinity groups like "Chicago" or "Marathons" that sound more like Eventbrite than executives.
 
At that point the Chief network settled into a pyramid-scheme model and invitations to join became automated. I know because I made a fake account on LinkedIn with a fake title at a fake company, and I received an email. But it reads like the target audience is investors who have heard too many complaints that Chief is all-white and all-BS:
 
A group of former Team Canada soccer players is alleging the former head coach of the 2008 Under-20 women's national team sent sexualized text messages to players, made sexual comments to players, touched players inappropriately and used his position of power to make sexual advances.
 
In a statement, the 12 women say each of them witnessed "incidents of abuse, manipulation, or inappropriate behaviour" by head coach Bob Birarda in 2007 and 2008, when he was in charge of both the U-20 women's national team and the Vancouver Whitecaps women's team.
 
The players are calling for an investigation into events in 2008 and say they would like the two organizations to implement better harassment policies and to retract coaching licences of those who demonstrate a pattern of abusive behaviour.
 
Last week, former Canadian team captain and Whitecaps captain Andrea Neil also issued a statement alleging that Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps were lacking accountability when it came to dealing with complaints against Birarda in 2008
 
The Vancouver Whitecaps issued a statement saying that in light of the players' allegations, "we are concerned there may be new information related to this matter that did not come forward in 2008 or since."
 
Canada Soccer issued a statement that reads in part: "Canada Soccer is aware that the Vancouver Police Department has been alerted to an anonymous website which allegedly contains further information regarding members of the 2008 Women's U-20 National Team Program.
 
"Canada Soccer does not have further details about this ongoing matter, or on the contents or accuracy of the website, but will support all efforts should it be determined that further action is required."
 
Eden Hingwing, one of the players behind the statement, says the group is coming forward now because of concerns that Birarda has continued to coach girls and young women, even after he was released from Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps in 2008.
 
"Bob Birarda was head coach for U-20 Canada, Whitecaps, and he was a reference for college coaches to call when we were seeking scholarship opportunities. I was afraid it would damage my soccer career if I ever complained," she said.
 
Former national team hopeful Adrienne Ruhe Lischke told CBC that during a U-20 training camp in 2008, Birarda called her to a meeting in his hotel room and closed the door, in contravention of a policy that said players were not to be alone with individual staff.
 
"I sat on one bed and he sat on the other and we didn't talk about soccer, which makes absolutely no sense," said Ruhe Lischke. " And I just remember him acknowledging that I wasn't in the starting pool and saying to me, 'What are you going to do about it?'"
 
"Absolutely. I don't know why that situation would occur for any other reason," she said. "I just remember being really confused and being like, 'I don't know what you mean?' And he would say: 'It's in your control, you're in charge of your own destiny.'"
 
She said she didn't report the incident to Canada Soccer at the time because she felt her complaint would not be taken seriously and that she could potentially suffer consequences in her soccer career.
 
In October 2008, six weeks before the U-20 Women's World Cup in Chile, Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps parted ways with Birarda in what was described by both organizations at the time as a "mutual decision."
 
CBC has asked Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps to see the independent investigator's report into Birarda's behaviour that was jointly commissioned in September of 2008. Neither organization has responded to the request.
