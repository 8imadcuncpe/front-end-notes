I prepared it focusing on the practice of word formation. Before students listen to the song they should try to preview what will be said by forming new words from the words given (good way to teach structure, word order in order to come up with the right word - noun, verb, adjective, adverb). It is a good way to elicit and stratch new vocabulary because students can come up with nonexisting words formed by wrong prefixes or sufixes as well as correct ones. It takes about 1 hour to be finished. Then, you can correct and also work with the dictionary in order to check the words formed and of course sing along and check the right one sang in the song!
 
In this post, you will find some exam practice exercises which help your students improve their score in the word formation**(Reading and Use of English part 3)** part of the **Cambridge Advanced**exam.

This part of the exam often turns out to be quite a challenge for advanced students and **it is no longer because they have major difficulties recognising correct parts of speech that go in the gaps**. What poses the biggest problem here is choosing**the best form** for the part of speech they have correctly identified.
 
I usually let my students have some quiet time to complete such a worksheet and then, while checking, I ask them to justify their choices. This is when I try to make sure their correct answer was not just a lucky guess. They get a chance to once again go through the strategy of reading the text carefully, **paying attention to details which might sometimes escape them**.

With this lesson, students talk about funding sources, address scepticism and watch a video about common myths of crowdfunding. They also explore vocabulary, analyse successful crowdfunding campaigns and create their own projects.
 
With this speaking lesson plan, students watch a video about growth and fixed mindsets and get plenty of opportunities to discuss them. They also learn some collocations referring to challenges and development, as well as practise word formation.
 
This lesson plan deals with synchronous and asynchronous communication. Apart from doing listening comprehension tasks, students will build adjectives with negative prefixes and learn some communication idioms.
 
This lesson plan about recruitment deals with unconscious bias among recruiters. The worksheet includes a lot of vocabulary as well as word formation tasks and includes a TED Talk by Gail Tolstoi-Miller.

Word formation is the addition of affixes like -ly and semi- to make longer words and different kinds of speech. Although it is often included in EFL exams and higher-level textbooks, it still probably gets just a few percent of the attention of lists of similar vocabulary, let alone tenses. Perhaps one reason for that is the lack of fun things you can do with it, something that this article seeks to start redressing.
 
Something similar can also be done with written exercises such as FCE Use of English word formation ones. Students fill the gaps with a mix of the real and wrong answers and other groups see if they can spot which is which.
 
This article proposes different activities to form words, which are useful and practical, because they range from very practical activities to activities that are a bit more rigid.
I think they are activities that I can implement, because they can help me improve my vocabulary. I did not know many of these exercises, but they are very ingenious, I liked them.
 
Me parece muy interesante ya que a travs de diferentes juegos didcticos estamos aprendiendo nuevo vocabulario teniendo otra perspectiva de ensear y entretener al alumno para que tenga ms ganas o amor por aprender otro idioma
 
I find it very interesting since through different didactic games we are learning new vocabulary having another perspective of teaching and entertaining the student to have more will or love to learn another language
