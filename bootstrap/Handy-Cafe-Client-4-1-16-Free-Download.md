Although the Internet is present in the vast majority of homes, and there are many free Internet spots in major cities, cybercafes are still a good business in places where Internet access is not widespread. HandyCafe is free software that allows you to keep track of the computers in your cybercafe. You can use it to track the time a computer is connected to the Internet, as well as the fee you can charge to the user.
 
Once installed, the program will run automatically showing the client on the right side of the screen. On its lower part, it shows the time in which the connection started, as well as the remaining and used time, and the fee incurred up to that moment. It is also possible to exit or log out from there.
 
You can also open the Options menu, from which you can disable or hide some of the features set on the interface. For example, you can hide all the options related to the time and fees, activate the USB protection, and change the language of the interface. This is an interesting option since it allows you to set the program's interface in German, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, and of course, in English.
 
The program has some drawbacks. For instance, when installing, it requires you to set your browser's home page to HandyCafe's website; otherwise, the installation will not continue. Also, the client shows some advertisements, and finally, the program does not have a Help file. Although the program is easy to use, some help will not be unwelcome.

The Internet cafe monitoring software MC3 Cyber Cafe Software has been primarily been designed to record and monitor activity on computer systems in Internet cafes. The monitoring software can also be installed and setup in different environments where computer monitoring is needed including home networks, schools or offices.
 
**Update**: The original software program was renamed to PenyuLAN Ganu Edition, a free and commercial software program that can be best described as an updated version of the original Cyber Cafe Software. Note that the developer stopped development of the application and that the developer website is no longer available. The program is compatible with all recent versions of Windows, however.
 
The free version has a limit of 4 PCs that you can manage using the program; since the developer website is no longer available, it appears that it is no longer possible to purchase the commercial version of the software to remove the four PC limit. You can download the program from third-party websites such as Softpedia.
 
The software program comes as a client and server version. The server version needs to be installed on the system administrator's computer system while the clients need to be deployed on all computer systems that need to be monitored.
 
The system administrator can monitor and record activity on all client computer systems. The default username and password are mouse and tikus. New user accounts with distinct rights can be created in the software program easily.
 
The admin interface itself is divided into different sections that include Internet, Printing and Reports among other sections. The Internet section opens the Internet monitoring system that displays the status of every computer system the client version of the monitoring software is running on.
 
The Internet cafe monitoring software comes with basic remote PC commands. It is for example possible to send messages to one or several of the client PCs and to logoff, reboot or shutdown the client PCs.
 
MC3 Cyber Cafe Software is an easy to use monitoring software program that is best suited for Internet cafes. The administrator might need some time to get used to working with the software program as it offers functionality that goes beyond Internet connection monitoring.
 
Hi Frank, I have updated the article. The original developer stopped development some time ago. You can download the software from third-party websites, or use one of the alternatives that I added to the article that are still maintained actively.
