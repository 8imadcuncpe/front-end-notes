**Peter Parker**, formerly known as **Spider-Man**, is the main antagonist of *Spider-Man: Edge of Time*. He is the alternative future version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man who turns out to be the CEO of Alchemax. He is intent on fixing the timeline so no one he loved will ever die and destroying the new 2099 Spider-Man; Miguel O'Hara.

Peter Parker's life started out the same way as it usually does: getting bitten by a radioactive spider, losing Uncle Ben, and becoming a superhero. However, upon losing everyone else he loved, he became convinced that he was never powerful enough to save anyone. He then gave up being a crime-fighter and eventually became the CEO of Alchemax. The anti-aging technology has allowed him to live longer than normally expected. Guilt-ridden over the loss of his loved ones, he was presumably working behind the scenes and capitalized on Walker Sloan's time gate technology and his trip into the past.
 
With the respective time periods of Miguel O'Hara and Peter Parker in flux, the Peter of 2099 planned to absorb the resulting energy to gain complete control over time and rewrite the reality in his image, bringing all those he cared about back from the dead. He battled Miguel O'Hara using an Iron Spider suit, but was quickly incapacitated by the combined efforts of Miguel and the loose tentacles of Atrocity stuck in the timestream. Peter is eventually defeated by Miguel and is presumably erased from history after his past-self saw the monster he would become.
 
Peter Parker was selfless once and dedicated his life as a young man to using his enhanced gifts to become a hero that helped and saved countless lives. Over the years, the amounted guilt of his inability to protect those he loved and the civilians who died because his failures drove him mad with guilt to the point of insanity and megalomania. Although keeping his beguile humor and wit, Parker displays little of the morals he did earlier as he only wished to rectify him of this guilt by saving those he could not, uncaring if the entire universe would collapse on itself as long as he could achieve this.
 
Believing himself more deserving of this than anyone on account of his previous heroic actions and what he sacrificed, the universe somehow owed him this and refused to class himself as a villain as all he wanted to do was to save lives. Moreover, Parker became deeply arrogant after settling into the CEO of Alchemax, claiming that Miguel O'Hara was a pretender to his name and went further to deride O'Hara by claiming he was the true villain for stopping his potentially-cataclysmic plan. Unfortunately, after becoming CEO, Parker was slowed down by his age and had to rely on the Iron Spider Suit to keep with the younger Miguel during their final fight at the Gateway.

Following his adventure twenty-five years into the future, Peter Pony Parker has been doing his best to live a normal life with his wife Twilight Sparkle and daughter Mayday. Of course, their friends are still by each other's side, but for now they enjoyed the peace.

That is, until Spider-Man 2099 warps in during a picnic. With the barriers between Earth and Equestria broken, as well as the very fabric of time. Peter must become Spider-Mane once more with his successor to defeat the mastermind Walker Sloan and his growing army.
 
The mare watched Peter and Spike looked at the treats, their eyes widening and she even saw Spike try to grab something in the basket, but Peter despite his hunger, resisted the urge, pressuring Spike to do the same.  
"I gotta have just one!" Spike mumbled, his clawed hand slowly reaching inside the basket.  
Peter shook his head. "No, Spike! Once we start we'll never finish!" he jokingly pleaded, exaggerating the situation at hoof. "The cupcakes are just too good!"  
"That's why I gotta have a bite!" Spike told his brother. Both of their stomachs were rumbling. The dragon held his gut. "Oh man... Soon, Peter, soon." he grumbled.  
Peter laid on his stomach, slowly reaching for Spike. "I'll make sure your sacrifice wasn't im vain, Spike!" he delcared, Spike pretending to pass out.
 
Trixie replied, "Yes, Rainbow! Trixie knows how to take a joke. After all, I've lived with Peter for what feels like an eternity."  
"Hey, you love my jokes and you know it!" Peter told his roomate with a smile. "What would you do without my witty and charming sense of humor?"  
"Not go insane?" Trixie answered.
 
"I promised that we'd help. Last thing we need is a repeat of what happened last time you did it on your own." Twilight told Applejack. "You were really sleep deprived the first one you did when I started to live here..."  
"Ugh... Baked bads..." Pinkie groaned, resisting the urge to gag.
 
"Who is Mysterio?" Trixie asked.  
Peter raised a hoof, "An old special effects artist who grew bitter because he couldn't get an acting career. He decided to use his genius as a criminal. He used his effects to create near-lifelike illusions to mess with me and other vigilantes that got in his way, like Daredevil or even the Punisher. Quentin Beck became the man with the fishbowl on his head himself, 'The Master of Illusion', Mysterio." explained Peter.  
"What a narcissist." Trixie huffed, each of her friends glaring at her after saying that. "What? Is there something in Trixie's teeth?" she poked her hoof in her mouth, wondering if that was such the case.
 
Another was a version of me still a teenager in high school, but I wore the black suit..."  
"Black suit..." Rarity paused, as though she was trying to figure something out. "Oh..." she recalled seeing that in Peter's memories, how it changed him and created one of the most vile creatures she had ever witness. "Why on Equestria would he take it back?"  
"I'm not too sure on Venom's status in that universe, but Madame Web made sure that he stayed in complete control of the suit while he wore it for that time. He really needed it too, but from what he told me and the other spiders it became a near pain because of what he was up against while wearing it. I kinda felt sorry for him."
 
"He also had gotten stuck fighting Deadpool. Poor kid..." he lightly laughed at the thought of fighting someone as loony as Wade again.  
"That crazy assassin..." Twilight groaned.  
"Hey! Wade's awesome!" Pinkie defended.  
"How do you two...?" Peter started to say something, but shook it off realizing that he was better off not knowing anyting about this, lest he lost his sanity. "Never mind."
 
"Oh that's right, sometime after we went our separate ways, I remember Madame Web telling me that a cartoon pig version of myself showed up, wondering what was going on. Spider-Ham was a little but late in that regard."
 
Something fell out of the portal. 'Not something. Someone.' he looked at the figure. It was a human. He wore a glowing blue costume of sorts, a red emblem covering his chest connecting to the back of his arms with spikes protruding off the wrists, and strange eyes that mimic the chest symbol.  
The man reached a hand out, his vision blurry and unable to see where he landed. The hand nearly touched Peter's muzzle, to which the stallion backed away slowly, the figure's hand dropping onto the ground in exhaustion.  
"No way..." Peter mumbled.  
"Parker... I need to f-find..." the man groaned before slipping into unconsciousness. A white aura lifted the man transforming him into someing else, his costume unable to fit his new body. The magic of the world changed him. They could see a pony underneath the now baggy costume.  
"Uh, Peter? Who is that?"  
Gulping, Peter answered with wide eyes. "That's Miguel O'Hara... The Spider-Man of 2099!"
 
A Spiders and Magic spin-off with Spider-Man 2099! From the looks of it, I think this may take place after the events of Part II and possibly sometime before or somewhere after Part III. And as the summary and title suggests, it will be based on the 'Spider-Man: Edge of Time' game. I like to see how this all goes.
 
With a defeated sigh, Rarity answered, "Yes, darling. Of course you can help. Actually, I am fascinated by these unstable molecules you mentioned," the unicorn used her magic to life up the costume to get a better look at it, "AndI love its design. I can't change the look too much, it's too good."
 
I'm conflicted: on one hand, it's nice that the ponies are going to take interest in Miguel's reality; on the other, of freaking course Rarity's interested in the fashion; then again, maybe I'm being too harsh: seeing future clothing could be a good way of being fashion FORWARD oh, geez: that was terrible  
also, "And I love", not "AndI love"
 
Suddenly, Miguel snapped awake sitting upward. His panting grew heavier by the second, sweat pouring down his face. He went to wipe it, but he felt no fingers do such an action for him, he looked to his appendage and saw a hoove instead of a hand. He screamed in shock, and in his panic shook himself out of the bed and landed face first on the floor.  
"I did the same thing too." Peter said.
 
"So, this is where you went after you left? All the sources never specified where you went
