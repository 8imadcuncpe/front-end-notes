These are subject to the Autodesk Previous Version Rights. These rights allow you to install and access specific previous versions, as well as the most recent version, but you can't exceed using the total number of current licenses at any given time. Note that most Autodesk software is backward compatible, so if you upgrade to the latest version, you can still access older drawings or files.
 
In most cases, you can download previous versions in Autodesk Account, with no need to request a new license. The following table summarizes the eligible previous versions available depending on the plan type. Follow the links for more information.

I ask because we are running on AutoCAD 2008 and are about to buy licenses for AutoCAD 2010/2011. Are files created in AutoCAD 2008 compatible in the newer versions? We'd like to avoid running two or more versions if possible.
 
"If you have a previous version of AutoCAD Architecture installed on your system, you can install a newer version of AutoCAD Architecture and keep other versions of the program on the same system. This is called a side-by-side installation. If you have purchased an upgrade version of AutoCAD Architecture, you are required to uninstall the previous version within 120 days of installing your newer product. See your license agreement for more information."
 
How do you install previous versions from an install disk of a newer version? I had Autocad3dMap2014, then my computer was reformatted and I have to reinstall CAD. We do not have the physical 2014 install disk. When requested, Autodesk sent version 2015. We've been told we can install version 2014 from it. How? I do not want to use CAD version 2015. It would need to work with a Carlson product of the same year and the Carlson 2015 version is not yet available. I do have the 2014 Carlson install cd. I also do not want to download from the internet. RIDICULOUSLY SLOW. Already tried it and got nowhere. Suggestions? Any help would be much appreciated.

I just downloaded and installed AutoCAD 2016 on my computer. There was a warning, saying that my computer's specs aren't on par with the system requirements of AutoCAD 2016. I have 2GB RAM, 32-bit OS, and my processor is i3. I want to download and install an older version of AutoCAD. Is this possible without erasing the 2016 version? And also, which version of AutoCAD would you recommend I install?
 
I need to work with both autocad and autocad electrical, yesterday my machine was running normally autocad 2016 until I installed autocad electrical 2018 and here came the disaster, the new 2018 autocad electrical did not work in addition to that I could not remove it even using ccleaner, and caused 0xc000007b error and I had to install new windows, my machine is very powerful, 8 gb rams, i7, 1tb hard drive, excellent external Graphics card, I can play cal of duty advanced warfare very smoothly, in your opinion have I made any mistake, or just the installing of the autocad and autocade electrical is an enough reason for this killer 0xc0007b. Thank you in advance
 
**Autodesk no longer supports offline activation for 2021 products and earlier.** If you have a perpetual license, activate your software by going online only once. After you activate online, you can continue to use 2021 software and earlier offline. This change doesn't apply to previous versions that you already activated offline; you can continue to use them as before.
 
One of the benefits of subscription plans is access to previous versions of your software. Support\* is available for all current versions of Autodesk software plus some previous versions. To be eligible for support, the Autodesk software must run on vendor-supported operating systems. If a vendor discontinues support for an operating system, we also discontinue support for Autodesk products running on that operating system, even if they are among the eligible previous versions.
 
If a previous version isn't listed, support isn't available. To avoid downtime, upgrade to a supported version before a previous version reaches the end of support. An active subscription plan without lapse indicates that you can continue to use a previously installed and activated version, even if it has reached end of support. If you have a perpetual license for a version that has reached end of support, you still have rights to use the license for as long as you want.
 
However, for unsupported versions, you can't get a new activation code to reactivate that version for any device. We also do not release software updates or hotfixes for versions that have reached the end of support\*.
 
Flex users and customers with an active subscription can download available previous versions of their products from their Autodesk account. You don't have to uninstall the current version to download and install a previous version.
 
You certainly can, there is no limit to the number of verticals you can install on one computer. Both (all) applications must be separately licensed and activated. Just do a normal installation and activation and all will be well. You become a separate desktop icon for each application, as you do when you have a vanilla AutoCAD installed from your vertical.
 
On some verticals you must simultaneously install Express Tools because it's not possible to install it afterwards as you can in vanilla AutoCAD. I don't know if this applies to all verticals and versions, but it certainly does to AutoCAD Civil 3D 2013 and 2013.
 
AutoCAD has a long history, and we go back all the way. Our primary developer started using AutoCAD with version 1.0 on the original IBM PC with a 10mb hard drive and CGA graphics (now we have mp3 files larger than that). Here is a detailed history, including corresponding drawing versions, .NET framework used, etc.
 
i make an autocad add on with dot net 3.50 and i reference to acdbmgd.dll,acmgd.dll from autocad 2012 what can I do to make it run on both autocad 2010 and autocad 2011 if i should reference to acdbmgd.dll,acmgd.dll from autocad 2010 where can i get this dll while i just have autocad 2012
 
I have had some success using 2008 libraries in AutoCAD 2010 so using the libraries from AutoCAD 2010 is probably your best bet, although not guaranteed to work. It will be depend on exactly what you are doing.
 
You can always use Reflection to call the functions (call them by name), but there will be a bunch of checks to be done, and it will be a lot of work to have your app. react the same way on all versions.
 
Your best bet (what i would do at least) would be to make a wrapper class for each functionability you want. For example, I would create a "MyCircle" class to manipulate circles, and then, inside this class, make a generic function (ex.: "ChangeThickness(int newThickness)"), and do your reflection code in there, so you can control how the call is made depending on the versions of AutoCAD installed (for example to not call a specific function in a certain version of AutoCAD because it contains a bug).This will make an expandable layer that you will be able to re-use in all version of AutoCAD, and you will be able to support any changes in the API.
 
Most cases its just copy paste some cases it will be different where in 2013 API have evolved for example in Civil3d 2012 there isnt any Co-Go point api where as in 2013 they have added that so in that case I need to change the code little bit to work in 2013.
 
The program I'm working on will be used on AutoCAD 2013 and 2002. So, what I'm doing is checking if the user has 2013 and if it is not present to try 2002. The problem comes when the code links the AcadApplication object to the opened instance of 2002.
 
The problem is not the version, since you're using COM to get AutoCAD. The GetObject calls worked back in VB6 days, so it's not that the AutoCAD.Application.15 object can't be created, it's that you're trying to cast it into a defined type it won't match. IN your project, what assembly do you have loaded that defines the AcadApplication type? I can guarantee you the 2002 and 2013 versions don't play nice together.
 
It will mean you won't have any intellisense while writing, and it will compile even if you've typed in methods/properties that don't exists. That means you may have methods that work for 2002 and not 2013 and vice versa. If you have to use .NET 3.5 or lower, Reflection would be the way to go.
 
While messing around with the answer that Locke gave, I found out if I ran the app as a x64 instead of x86 the app would work with Acad 2002. I have to use the 2000 object library and it won't open 2013 anymore because of the same error. So, I have to build two different versions of the app. One for 2002 version run as x64 and one for the 2013 version which will work whether it's x64 or x86. Someone smarter than me could probably tell us why.
 
AutoDesk does not change the AutoCAD Drawing File Format nearly as frequently asit releases new versions, at least recently. In the early days the DWG fileformat was changing with pretty much every release, but while the format changefor AutoCAD 2013, it did not change again until AutoCAD 2018, despite yearlyreleases of the program. So, the same file format was used for AutoCAD 2013,AutoCAD 2014, AutoCAD 2015, AutoCAD 2016 and AutoCAD 2017. Similarly, the formatis identical for AutoCAD 2018, AutoCAD 2019 and AutoCAD 2020.
 
It is easy to decipher what version of AutoCAD created a given drawing file.
