So my experience is more with a different make but similar hardware, and when this happens it usually means you have to calibrate the printer. Sometimes there is an app you can use on the print server, otherwise an option on the printer it self.
 
Are you printing from an actual label program which would use its own printer drivers, or are you using a Windows driver? I have noticed years ago when I ran into this that the behavior when printing from Word using a Windows driver would be that the printer would behave as if it was receiving 1,000 single-page printouts rather than a single 1,000-page printout. Pausing just buffers the info enough to eliminate the pauses between pages (labels). If only running small batches, then you probably would not run into pausing between labels after pausing the printer.
 
Its not the application because a GK420D zebra printer is working fawless.
The printer is just stopping for a second between each print.
I am missing the deselect pause option in the printer settings as seen in the .
the gk420 driver printer settings advanced option.

Does the counter on the printer keep saying PRINTING 1 of 1 when you send a print job of multiple labels, or does it say PRINTING 1 of 50, 2 of 50, etc. with a pause at each increment? Is the pause consistently the same amount of time, or is it more random?
 
Print job are not large we now use a GK420 network label printer without any problem.
The TMS application is using the windows driver only. The application has no own drivers.
The labels are not large size is standard 6x4. Printing directly did not change the problem.
 
**Step 1:** Unbox the PT1000 printer and plug in to power and use the USB printer cable to connect to your Windows computer. Load a roll of pass printer paper with the pass paper being fed from the top of the roll instead of underneath. Ensure printer is powered on.
 
**Step 6:**Click on the configure button to open up the printer pass configuration window. Use the drop down to select the Pass Printer and Click on the Calibrate PT1000 printer button to calibrate the printer and ensure that the passes are centered when printed.

My printer has stopped printing black ink even though the black cartridge is almost full, I have read on previous threads that many people solved this problem by installing the most recent drivers which I have now done or by cleaning the ink cartridges via the toolbar; however my toolbar is incredibly simplistic to the point that there is not even an option to check ink levels.
 
I would like to assist you today with resolving the print quality issue you're experiencing with your HP Deskjet 1000 Printer failing to print black ink. Now, from the screen shots you included in your post, it appears that on reinstalling the drivers the full feature software and driver package failed to make its way onto your computer. What you're seeing is the basic driver options. In order to correct the black ink quality issue we rely on the full software to be installed to provide you with the maintenance tools. Therefore, can I please have you follow the steps below to get your printer properly installed.
 
Once the software opens can you please click **here** to access the print quality troubleshooting steps to correct the black printing issue. This issue may be due to a cartridge issue or a print system hardware issue within your actual printer. Once the support document opens please run through**Solution one, Solution six, Solution seven,** and**Solution eight**. This includes any sub-steps under the listed Solutions.
 
Once you click that link please allow it to **Run** if you have that option. If not, please **Save** the patch on your desktop. Once the download is complete if prompted allow it to **Run**. You may see something flash on your screen and disappear. After this happens please click on the HP Printer Assistant software to launch it properly.
 
I followed everything you said including copying and pasting the link into internet explorer. The patch downloaded, extracted and the little window disappeared as you said it would but it still didn't fix the software.
 
I'm sorry to hear that the patch still didn't resolve your Printer Assistant error. The dilemma is, the black ink printing issue is hardware related on your Deskjet. Unfortunately, this issue is usually due to a defective cartridge or a defective print system within your printer. If you try a new black cartridge and the issue persists, than we know that this issue is being caused by the printer. Should this be the case, than a whole unit replacement may be needed.
 
The challenging part is because your product only offers basic features we rely on the Printer Assistant software to run the print quality troubleshooting steps to ideally resolve this black printing issue. So, with that being said, I can either offer you some additional troubleshooting steps in an effort to get your Printer Assistant software functioning again for you to continue troubleshooting your printer. Or, if you have another computer we could install the printer on there temporarily to complete the quality troubleshooting.
 
This Printer Assistant issue is being caused by a file association issue within your Operating System. There are steps that I can provide you with to correct this software issue should you want to continue troubleshooting the software on this computer.
 
Please let me know if you would like to continue support on the HP Printer Assistant with this Windows 7 computer, or if you would like to install the printer temporarily on another computer just to complete the print quality troubleshooting steps. I look forward to hearing from you!
 
I have a laser printer (Samsung ML-2010) that is in good condition, it works in Windows and old linuxes, but not with my fresh installation of ArchLinux. The printer is recognised and configured, but not printing, saying about any job:
 
For the benefit of anyone seeing this error message in 2019, a possible cause is an incompatibility between older versions of cups-filters and recent versions of ghostscript. Upgrading the former or downgrading the latter resolves the issue.
 
Note that upgrades to cups-filters were not released for some platforms (e.g. Raspbian Stretch on the Raspberry Pi) until mid-June 2019, so if this did not work in the past try sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade again.
 
For users of the Raspberry Pi and possibly certain other Debian-based platforms that experienced this issue in May-June 2019, the problem was that ghostscript and libgs9 were upgraded two or three weeks before the upgraded versions of cups-browsed, cups-filters, cups-filters-core-drivers, libcupsfilters1, and libfontembed1 were made available in the Raspbian repos. Running sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade again on or after June 14, 2019 should hopefully fix the problem.
 
I just solved a problem very similar to this. It was caused by the spring 2019 Debian upgrade. To solve it, I added "oldstable" to my Debian sources.list and then I was able to downgrade several packages. I downgraded:
 
Samsung\_M2020\_Series.ppd is a PostScript Printer Description using cups-filters (CUPS-PPD), in its particular case a cups-filter named rastertospl. This cups-filter is provided and installed by the Samsung Print Driver for Linux at /opt/smfp-common/printer/bin/rastertospl (discoverable for CUPS/the OS printing infrastructure via the installer-created symlink /usr/lib/cups/filter/rastertospl).
 
Using apt-file search libcupsimage.so.2 shows that libcupsimage.so.2 is provided with the Debian package libcupsimage2]( ). Since installing it with sudo apt install libcupsimage2 I can succesfully print.
