Empowering Women in Manufacturing is a leadership programme targeted to female MSc and PhD students in manufacturing environments (engineering, science, maths, etc) and women employed in manufacturing. The leadership programme combines mentorship with training on innovation, entrepreneurship, digitisation, management. The programme includes networking opportunities and career development mentoring.
 
I strongly recommend STRADA to all women who would like to achieve both personal and professional growth. High-quality teachers, variegate teaching topics and several possibilities to interact make this program unique and worth the commitment.
 
Being part of this initiative has been a transformative experience, equipping me with essential knowledge and connections that will undoubtedly drive positive changes in the metal sector's innovation landscape. I am truly thankful for the support, guidance, and learning opportunities that the program has provided.
 
My experience as a mentor in STRADA program has been incredibly rewarding. Over the past three years, as a young entrepreneur, I've developed my leadership abilities and accelerated my learning across various personal and business domains.
 
The "Women in Manufacturing" program provided me with an excellent opportunity to be a mentor; It was a great chance to reassess my knowledge and expertise, deepen my understanding of my profession, and simultaneously assist another woman in her growth.
 
STRADA has provided me with a well designed programme, methodology and tools that complement my past experience as a Mentor. I have learnt from the mentoring needs and feedback received from my Mentee and I have been inspired by her enthusiasm and bright potential.
 
The programme has supported in my leadership development how to understand my mentee's needs and how to set actual goals, and how well I can communicate & manage with my mentee.This leadership journey encouraged the both me and my mentee to share our insights.
