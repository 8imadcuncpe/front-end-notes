I tried the JarDesign website, but the link took me to an page that suggested me to search(???). And of course no result. It's a common rule that so complicated airplanes contain a manual and documentation in the package. Hopefully a tutorial as well.
 
I do not consider them that complicated. They are in the intermediate level and that is exactly the issue with the FCOM documents. It will be up to you to figure out if a specific feature you read about was actually correctly implemented if implemented at all.

The Airbus Customer Care team assist you with a set of EASA approved Airworthiness Documents to manage unforeseen events or undocumented instructions. We are qualified to deliver Airworthiness approved documents, under Design Organisation Approval, which can then be used to support requests to National Airworthiness Authorities.
 
Airbus Customer Care proposes a range of PDS Airworthiness Documents\* on pre-identified topics, such as Parking & Storage maintenance tasks, Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR), Structure maintenance tasks, etc.
 
The PDS Airworthiness Documentation offers you the possibility to tackle at once a package of maintenance tasks related to a similar matter, therefore optimising time, energy and cost by limiting the need for individual requests and removing payment per MSN for a series of analyses.
 
\*By default, Airbus produces on-demand engineering analysis leading to tailored Airworthiness Documentation delivery. This documentation is specifically tailored to your expressed maintenance or operational needs.
 
During a manual start on a A320, the **ENG MAN START P/B** opens the start valve which then runs the starter motor. During the MAN START process, at some point, the start valve closes automatically. What are the risks associated with continuing to leave the **MAN START P/B** ON at this point?
 
Well, documentation is a bit vague about this, and I suppose a technician would know more about the different things the ENG MAN START bp is doing, but from a quick glance at the FCOM there is one major difference that I can spot:
 
To my understanding, the input from the MAN START switch (a ground/open discrete into the Engine Interface Unit), is only taken into account by the FADEC logic if the engine is not already running. Once the engine control logic goes into running mode (i.e. N2 rises above idle), it will stay in that mode until the engine master lever (EML) is set to Off, regardless of whether the engine is lit or not.

In other words, once the engine has started, the position of the MAN START p/b is irrelevant, even if the engine flames out (however, note that the FCOM procedures for engine failure often call for the EML to be set to Off, at which point the position of the MAN START switch comes to play in any subsequent attempt to relight the engine).
 
One risk I can think of is that if you are on the ground, shut the engines down, or even power off the aircraft, then when you power everything back on and attempt to start an engine (i.e. turn the engine start selector to IGN), the autostart procedure will be inhibited by the MAN START switch being already on, and the FADEC will go into manual start mode instead.If you then immediately set the EML to On (which wouldn't be a problem during a normal autostart), fuel would start to flow right away, while the engine may still be below the required minimum N2 for fuel admission (16%), therefore the engine could fail to start or worse (an engine fire).
 
This documentation presents an example of a VOR/DME approach performed with an Airbus 320 at DABB on the runway 18.
This type of approach is a non-precision approach due to the fact that only lateral guidance is provided using a VOR.
The pilot-in-command is in charge of the descent.
 
In this document we will show you how to do the VOR/DME approach without using your LNAV function but according to the A320 SOP It's recommended to use the LNAV fonction while performing a **Non ILS Approach** like the VOR/DME .
 
CFM International Inc. says 68 jet engines were fitted with spare parts backed by fraudulent documentation from a little-known UK-based supplier, a sign that fake components may have been installed on certain older-model aircraft.
 
Regulators, airlines and other industry players have since been scouring their records to hunt down the suspect components sold by AOG, the obscure supplier at the center of the crisis. AOG has no direct affiliation with CFM or its partners.

NAVBLUE and Airbus have demonstrated their pioneering spirit once more by developing the eQRH application that allows, for the first time, to operate a fully paperless flight deck! eQRH naturally integrates into Flysmart+ and can also be purchased as a separate application.
 
Includes Ops Library Browser Web, Performance Administration Application (PAA) and the Ground Administration and Servicing tools (GAS) or Gateway for administrating Flysmart+ EFB data and software updates.
 
The service consists in ensuring remotely the data management and administration of your Electronic Flight Bag for efficient flight operations in the flight deck. The service is divided in two steps: **Initial Setup**(Administration settings, Initialization of Performance and Load sheet data, Initialization of the non-customized operational documentation) and **Recurring phase**(Update airport data, performance database and admin settings at every AIRAC cycle; Prepare & deliver the EFB loads of the operational documentation).
 
NAVBLUE experts can deliver a specific study or recurring service, no matter your aircraft types, to alleviate as far as possible any limitations on current operations or to perform all tasks required for opening any new route and airport:
