I've tried going through this process of resetting a password for a friend who is struggling to get in to her account but still no joy. She cannot remember the security question answers, she has taken the automated call and entered the codes but the only choice of further verification in the dropdown box is the security questions, and nothing else.
 
What is the next step? We cannot seem to contact PayPal because we need a one time code in order to call them?!? Surely that's a chicken and egg situation. Is there a number she can call to just have her email account have a reset password link sent to it, or her phone?

We keep getting emails from paypal that have nothing to do with us using my wifes email. She's not autherized any paypal accounts or anything so how on earth is someone using her email to defraud other poor souls when it's not even been verified from her email address.
 
I've emailed Paypal, I've phoned Paypal, I've emailed them again notifying them of the situation and they seem like they have as much power over their own system as a flatulance in a storm. They wanted us to contact microsoft and tell them to call paypal saying we own the email. I call microsoft and appently we can only be eligable for support if we pay their $99 support fee and even then they wouldn't do that as it's not something they do anyway! Paypal won't give us any details despite us supplying info on the emails, the account name its been opened up in and other details.
 
It's crazy. I just want a stop put to this account. Paypal have the persons numbers and address's. Why cant they contact 'them' and say they're sending an email that they must reply to else their account will be suspended. The person wouldn't be able to respond as it would come to us and we could stop all this.
